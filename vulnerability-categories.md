- [Stored, Reflected and DOM XSS in Google for Work Connect (GWC)](http://respectxss.blogspot.com/2016/02/stored-reflected-and-dom-xss-in-google.html) by Ashar Javed
  - Stored XSS - title of the post entered by user was encoded properly, but not the one created by the Google Drive file.
  - Reflected XSS - an error message in a GET parameter.
  - DOM XSS - Javascript code executes only if someone marked/clicked the reply of a posting "Mark as Helpful".

#### Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS)

- [Managed Apps and Music: a tale of two XSSes in Google Play](https://ysx.me.uk/managed-apps-and-music-a-tale-of-two-xsses-in-google-play/) by Yasin Soliman
  - This blog listed some google resources that are very useful for google bug hunters.
  - Payload `https://play.google.com/schools/termsofservice?continue=javascript:confirm(document.domain)` (two limitions for exploitaiton).
  - Payload `https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/sr/'"><img src=x onerror=confirm(document.domain)>` (straightforward, actually this was a stored XSS).

#### Stored Cross-Site Scripting (Stored XSS)

- [A Few of My Favorite Facebook Stored XSS Findings](http://www.breaksec.com/?p=6129) by Nirgoldshlager
  - Three old but interesting and critical Facebook strored XSSes which the author happened to find them in the right location.
- [XSS on Facebook-Instagram CDN Server bypassing signature protection](https://www.amolbaikar.com/xss-on-facebook-instagram-cdn-server-bypassing-signature-protection/) by Amol Baikar
- [XSS on Facebook’s acquisition Oculus CDN](https://www.amolbaikar.com/xss-on-facebooks-acquisition-oculus-cdn/) by Amol Baikar
  - Bypassing signature protection on Facebook's CDN server, uploading `.jpg` pictures containing malicious payload, accessing the `.jpg` by changing extion to `.html`.
- [Stored XSS in Google Drive (Folder Name)](https://pwnrules.com/google-drive-stored-xss/) by Ibrahim Raafat
  - An old blog, creating a folder with malicious payload name, searching about any place which need writing the folder name in the page.
- [Sleeping stored Google XSS Awakens a $5000 Bounty](https://blog.it-securityguard.com/bugbounty-sleeping-stored-google-xss-awakens-a-5000-bounty/) by Patrik Fehrenbach
  - Payload (`"><img src=x onerror=javascript: alert(1);`) in project title was fired when delete the project.
  - This was not classified as a low level self XSS, because the Google Cloud Platform can be used by multiple users, if a user creates a project with a malicious XSS payload, that payload could be used against the project administrator to execute malicious javascript (if they delete the project).

#### DOM Cross-Site Scripting (DOM XSS)

### Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

### Business Logic Flaw

### Brute Force

### Simple Remote Code Execution (Simple RCE)

### Clickjacking

### Open Redirection

- [Use Two Open Redirects to Trigger an XSS in Google website - Open redirects that matter](https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/best-reports/openredirectsthatmatter) by Tomasz Bojarski
  - This is a complicated writeup writen by Google security engineer, with detailed techques analyzing.
  - The writer started with the report, analyzing how the proc finally was triggered. The reader could even read the source code of the website.
  - To bypass the prefix check, using `https://picasaweb.google.com/data/feed/api/../../../bye`.
  - To bypass the prevention of MIME sniffing vulnerabilities, triggering an error. The error message should contain HTML code.
  - Open redirects are super useful in bug chains, especially when used to bypass a prefix-based URL whitelist.
  - It's also useful to set up your own server to respond with various invalid header valuse, as not everything can be tested using a tampering proxy alone.
